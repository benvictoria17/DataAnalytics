I was intrigued by what this completely different OS was all about, so, by his recommendation I grabbed the latest version of Ubuntu, which at the time was 10.04. I absolutely loved it! Coming from Windows vista, the Gnome 2 desktop with multiple workspaces was revolutionary. But alas, I gamed a lot and, as a soon-to-be Game Design major, there was a lot of software with no hope of running, even with Wine, so for a few years Linux remained as something I'd dual boot into, or mess around with for fun. I absolutely loved (and still do) the fact that I could just about poke anywhere without the system telling me ""no"", unlike Windows. Then recently, with the Edward Snowden reveals and later with the Windows 10 EULA announcement I said ""nope"" and switched to Linux completely and I haven't really looked back since. I still keep a 500gb hard drive on my computer with Windows on it, for software I need for school (tried bargaining to no avail), accessing it through a VM with GPU passthrough, but even then, it gets little use. I haven't stopped at myself either, over the past (almost) year now that I've been using Linux ""exclusively"" I've converted my parents, grandparents, friends and girlfriend, and they all seem to like it much more than Windows.","I love the freedom and control it gives me. When I use Linux it feels like it's MY computer and no one else's. I love the flexibility of it, allowing me to do many incredible and amazing things with relative ease.
