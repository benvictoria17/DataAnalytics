The emphasis on grades and the bell curve system in University takes away the fun in learning I experienced on exchange. Since everyone gets an absolute score, the students are always ready to help one another out, discussions are less brutal about who is right and who is wrong but how we can all learn together. Overall, my life in University has only been made a little better through the different non-academic experiences I have been through.

Academic pursuits shouldn’t be the focus of a student and neither should the focus be on how good a student is in all aspects like academics and ccas and volunteering work and leadership. This does not foster a good learning environment for students, there’s always a motive behind doing something and it’s not driven by passion, like it’s for the sake of a resume. I’d like to be able to enjoy CCAs without affecting my studies. Bell curve is something that is undesired because it creates an environment where people are unwilling to help each other because when one person does poorer, you’ll perform relatively better. I think a bell curve and an expectation to be an all rounder is what makes student life rather toxic, not to mention people who don’t participate in group work (could be due to CCAs or other reasons they may provide)."

I feel that for my course academics are ideally manageable, but when group work comes into play sometimes there are instances where one has to put in alot more hard work than someone else to bring a piece of work up to standard, without recognition nor reward, especially when the end grade is the same. This is rather unsettling, because this requires additional time on the part of the student which cannot be used for him or her to invest in other areas of growth that can help enhance his or her resume which could be very unfair. This is especially because academics are usually judged by CAP only, and leadership in these academic projects is generally not considered actual leadership in the eyes of employers. For top industries like consulting and investment banking where CAP is the first screening criteria, this can be a source of unfairness. Working on addressing this unfairness will go a long way to recognizing students and their hard work, rather than rewarding what appears to be highly individualistic and selfish behaviour which comes with a common score in group projects. This will allow all students to have an opportunity to pursue student life endeavours rather than be held back from enjoying student life activities by having to put in additional time and effort performing academic work for others who fall short of doing so."
