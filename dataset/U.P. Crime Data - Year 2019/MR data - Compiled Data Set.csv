Police said the families of the girl and the minor accused are neighbours.

Ghaziabad,"This gang posed as cops to extort youths, couples","GHAZIABAD: Five persons were arrested on Monday for allegedly extorting money from people in Delhi-NCR and other cities posing as Delhi Police officers. The accused have been identified as Manoj Rawal, the gang leader and resident of Gautam Budh Nagar, Sunil Kumar, a resident of Sultanpuri in Delhi, Dilshad, a resident of Delhi’s Vijay Vihar, Lalit Khokhar, a resident of Chhaprauli in Baghpat, and Jitendra Tyagi, who is from Kavi Nagar. A police uniform, a Mahindra Xylo and five country-made pistols were recovered from their possession. “The leader of the gang is Manoj Rawal. He was jailed in 2009 for murdering his brother after an argument in a drunken state. The accused were caught from near Old Bus stand when they were planning to rob a car on Meerut road,” SP (city) Shlok Kumar said. An FIR has been registered against the accused under sections 171 (wearing garb used by public servant with fraudulent intent), 399 (making preparations to commit dacoity), 402 (assembling for purpose of committing dacoity) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Sihani Gate police station. Speaking about the gang’s modus operandi, police said one of them used to don the Delhi Police sub-inspector’s uniform while the other would pose as plainclothes officers. They used to park their car by the roadside and conduct ‘checking’ of vehicles in secluded areas during the night. The accused extorted money from people involved in illicit liquor smuggling, as well as from other commuters, threatening to book them for ‘suspicious movement’. Sources said the gang members mostly targeted vehicles driven by youths or in which couples were travelling. “Targeting them was easier as they would generally not report the matter to police. The gang didn’t come under the police radar as most of their victims were themselves involved in some or the other illegal activities,” a police officer said. ",,,,,,,,,,

Shivam, who works with a catering agency, was attacked around 11am on Saturday just 20 metres from his house in Gagan Vihar colony. He is currently battling for his life at GTB Hospital in Delhi. Doctors said Shivam had suffered more than 50% burns. Police and Shivam’s family gave conflicting versions of what prompted the attack on the 16-year-old boy.

He had resisted their attempt, but they fled after slashing his hands with a blade. My brother did not tell us anything about the attack on him that day,” Shiva said. “On Saturday, when Shivam saw the trio sitting in a park, he went up to them and asked for his phone back. They first beat him up with sticks and then set him on fire. He would have died on the spot itself had locals not come to his rescue,” he added. SHO Singh said the three accused — Rajiv Sharma, Salman and Munna — were on the run. According to sources, they are involved in petty crimes in the area. The three have been booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC and under provisions of the SC/ST Act. ",Money Disputes,1,,,,,,,,

Ghaziabad,"Cornered, burglar dangling from gas pipe falls 9 floors to his death","GHAZIABAD: A burglar dangling from a thin gas pipeline fell nine floors to his death while trying to escape a group of guards, one of whom had his gun aimed at him. The burglar had raided a flat in Amba G Residency of Indirapuram early on Wednesday when the owner arrived and raised an alarm. The ninth-floor flat that he had burgled belongs to a couple — Sumit and Ruhani — who work in night shifts in private firms in Noida. Ruhani had just opened the main door after returning from office around 4.30am when she found the house ransacked. She informed the guards of the housing society, who ran upstairs. “We had taken a round of the compound around 4.10am. A little later, the owner of the flat arrived. When she opened the door, she found the house rummaged. She suspected there was somebody moving on the balcony and alerted us,” security supervisor Bhanu Pratap said. Police identified the burglar as Dharmendra alias Dev, who was in his 30s. Sources said he lived in Kalyanpuri in East Delhi and had been jailed in the past in Gujarat. Cops suspect he climbed to the terrace of Block A and entered the apartment through the kitchen after jumping onto the parapet of the balcony. After Ruhani raised the alarm, Bhanu and the gunman, Mohan Pal, rushed to the flat but found nobody on the balcony. They went to the terrace to check but could not find anyone there either. Mohan was sent downstairs to check again. “We too were going downstairs but stopped after hearing footsteps on the terrace. We rushed to the terrace, but there was nobody. Soon, a few residents had started gathering downstairs,” said Bhanu. Dharmendra was finally spotted holding on to the gas pipeline coming out of another flat on the ninth floor. “Mohan Pal aimed the gun at him and flashed his torchlight. He was trying to slide down the gas pipe. Bhanu Pratap and another guard were on the terrace and the gunman was right below the balcony. The burglar panicked and it seems his hands slipped. He landed on the concrete ground with a thud, face down,” maintenance worker Akhilesh Maurya said. Police said the man, who seemed to be in his 30s, was in a pair of blue denims, a deep blue hooded jacket, sports shoes, black gloves and a deep maroon monkey cap. A toy gun, which had broken from the fall, was found on him along with a pair of large screw drivers, pliers, cutters and a packet of red chilli powder. Police said he had stashed some stolen ornaments and Rs 9,900 cash in a pouch tied to his waist. Two Alpenliebe and Pulse toffees were also found inside the pouch. He was rushed to a government hospital in Ghaziabad, where he was declared brought dead. Members of the apartment owners’ association said he could not have entered through the main gate as cameras are installed there. “There is a vacant plot adjacent to our society. He could have entered from that side after scaling the iron fence. The cameras there are under maintenance,” AOA secretary Astha Jain said. An FIR has been registered at Indirapuram police station under Section 380 (theft in dwelling house) of the IPC. “The body has been sent for an autopsy. It seems he had done a recce of the area,” Ghaziabad SP (City) Shlok Kumar said. ",,,,,,,,,,

Ghaziabad,"55-year-old killed in fire, narrow escape for 40 in Loni building","GHAZIABAD: A 55-year-old man died while his son suffered burn injuries trying to save him when an electric wire in the basement of a three-storey building caught fire and the flames spread quickly to the top floors in Loni on Saturday night. Most of the families were asleep when the fire broke out in the basement, which is used as a parking space for two-wheelers. Seven motorcycles parked there were reduced to cinders. The deceased has been identified as Sunil Sagar, an auto driver, while his son Rohit (22) is a courier boy. Rohit, who suffered burns in the limbs and chest, has been admitted to GTB Hospital. The family lives in a flat on the first-floor of the building. The building, constructed on two adjacent plots, has 24 one-bedroom flats, of which 17 are occupied. Residents said there were around 40 people in the building when the fire broke out. “Smoke spread quickly through the stairwell into the top floors as the motorcycles caught fire. Those living on the first and second floors rushed to the terrace and crossed over to the adjoining building, which shares its wall with our apartment. A family of four was trapped inside a ground-floor flat as the blaze was most intense near their doorway. They sprayed water on the flames, but to no avail. Neighbours rescued them after breaking the grille of their balcony,” said Gaurav Sharma (32), an accountant who lives on the second floor. Residents of the building and neighbours had rushed to help before the fire tenders could arrive. Atul Mishra, a pharma company employee, said Rohit was injured while trying to save his father. “Rohit had rushed to the terrace but soon realised that his father had been left behind. He returned to his flat to fetch his father, but could not find him. By that time, the flames had spread to the top floors and he suffered burns,” Mishra said. The fire department said they received an alert around 12.15am. Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot. “The residents, except for the father-son duo, had all escaped unhurt by the time our fire tenders reached the building. Around four to five flats on the ground and first floors were damaged,” chief fire officer Sunil Kumar Singh said. Electricity department officials said the fire had started possibly because of faults in the building’s worn-out wires. “The main electricity panel of the building had been sealed inside a metal box and locked during a drive undertaken in 700 houses in Loni recently. The panel box was found intact with its lock. Though the building has 24 flats, there is no agency to look after its maintenance. Several wires near the electricity panel have been joined and repaired by residents themselves. Since room heaters are used during winter, the old wires could have caught fire because of the increased load,” discom executive engineer PK Goyal said. No case had been registered till late Sunday evening. “An autopsy was conducted and its report is awaited. Suffocation is the probable cause of his death. The victim’s son has suffered around 40% burns,” said Sanjay Verma, the SHO of Loni police station. ",,,,,,,,,,
Ghaziabad,Father booked for abducting woman soon after marriage at registrar’s,"GHAZIABAD: Four persons, including the father and cousin of a 23-year-old woman, were booked on Monday, allegedly for abducting her at gunpoint from outside a marriage registrar’s office in Ghaziabad. The case was registered at Sihani Gate police station after the Allahabad high court issued an order directing cops to produce the woman, Neetu, in court latest by January 30. The woman is yet to be traced. Neetu had allegedly been abducted on the afternoon of November 19 outside Sadar tehsil office where she had arrived along with her male friend, Yogesh (25), for registration of their marriage. Yogesh and Neetu, classmates since their school days in 2007, had arrived in Ghaziabad from their home town Sahadabad in Hathras district of UP in a Zest car a day earlier. Yogesh told TOI that he had informed the police control room immediately after the incident and had also lodged a complaint. However, police kept on delaying registration of the case saying it was being investigated whether the crime actually took place in Ghaziabad. “We decided to get married in October last year and told our families about our plan. Neetu’s parents were firmly against the marriage because our families belong to the same gotra. She was tortured and beaten up by her family members who also issued death threats to me. Then we decided to get married at the registrar’s office in Ghaziabad for our own safety,” Yogesh told TOI. According to Yogesh, around 15 men in two vehicles abducted Neetu soon after they walked out of the tehsil office following solemnisation of the marriage. “I asked a friend, Santosh, who lives in Delhi, to accompany us to the registrar’s office. Santosh and Neetu were waiting for me a short distance away as I went to fetch my car. Since there was a lot of rush in the lane outside the tehsil, I got delayed in getting back to them with the car. Neetu was abducted during this time at gunpoint. The men threatened Santosh and physically assaulted him too. There has been no trace of Neetu ever since and we fear the worst,” said Yogesh. A habeas corpus petition on behalf of Neetu was filed by Yogesh from Agra, where he went to live in a house belonging to his family after the incident. The high court, where the writ had been filed, issued the order to police on December 21. The FIR has been registered under sections 365 (kidnapping), 323 (assault) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. The woman’s father, Sachipal Singh, and his brother Mukesh Singh have been named as accused in the FIR. “The case was registered only after we were fully convinced that she was kidnapped from Ghaziabad. The woman has not been traced yet,” said SP (city) Shlok Kumar. ",,,,,,,1,4,1,

Around 20kg of silver ingots were recovered from the gang upon arrest. The seventh member of the gang is still absconding. The factory, Rajdoot Organics, located in Khuskheda industrial area of Alwar belongs to one Naresh Agarwal. His complaint stated that the robbers escaped with around 70kg of silver from the factory. According to police sources, the robbery was planned by the gang’s kingpin, Mintu alias Bittu (32), in Bhiwadi jail of Rajasthan where he had been imprisoned last year in a case of loot.

Ghaziabad,"7-year-old on vacation slips into septic tank outside home, dies","GHAZIABAD: A seven-year-old girl who was on a vacation at her maternal grandparents’ place in Ghaziabad’s Khoda area died after allegedly slipping into an underground septic tank just outside their house on Wednesday. The accident occurred around 2.30pm when the septic tank of the house in Kala Enclave was being cleaned by workers. Rukshana Bano was immediately pulled out of the tank by the workers and rushed to a hospital in Delhi, bordering Khoda, where she was declared brought dead. Rukshana’s maternal grandfather Aqiullah Khan said she had gone to Khoda, along with her maternal grandmother Nisha, on December 17 to spend the winter vacation. Rukshana had been living with Nisha at Machhri village in Ambedkar Nagar district for the past five years after her parents divorced and her mother Saira Bano got remarried. “The septic tank is attached to the lavatory of my house. Workers had lowered pipes into the tank with which they were pumping out sewage water from the tank using a pump. Rukshana, who had gone outdoors to play, missed a step while entering the house and slipped into the tank,” Khan told TOI. Workers immediately pulled her out as locals raised a huge alarm. “They pumped out more water and a worker descended into the tank to bring out the body. They took her to a government hospital in Delhi, where she was declared brought dead. Police were informed about the accident around 4.30 pm,” said local police outpost in-charge Mahak Singh. However, officials of Khoda Nagar Palika Parishad, the municipal body of the township, denied that the cleaning work was being undertaken by them. “We do not have sucker machines. Neither do we engage in cleaning septic tanks of households. The operator must have been privately engaged by the houseowner. Locals in Khoda generally get their septic tanks cleaned with the help of private contractors,” said executive officer KK Bhadana. Ghaziabad police said a post-mortem will be conducted on the body. “We have not received any formal complaint yet from the family of the deceased. Any legal action will be initiated on the basis of the autopsy report. Prima facie, it seems the girl drowned,” said Khoda police station SHO Pradeep Tripathi. ",,,,,,,,,,

Ghaziabad,Man sleeping on footpath dies after board falls on him,"GHAZIABAD: Rains also brought Ghaziabad to its knees as it led to waterlogging and massive rush-hour jams on several arterial roads. One rain-related death was also reported from the collectorate area, where a 60-year-old rickshaw-puller died when a hoarding collapsed on the pavement where he was sleeping. But the worst hit was Indirapuram, where half-a-dozen vehicles broke down on waterlogged roads and stranded commuters had to wade through dirty streams of water to reach to safety. And with the rains came the power outage, with most parts of the city plunging into darkness. “The scene on Indirapuram’s roads on Tuesday morning was one of utter chaos as every street was waterlogged,” said DK Pandey, a resident of Arihant Harmony. “There were at least half-a-dozen instances where school buses, trucks broke down stuck in potholed roads, triggering massive snarls in the township,” he added. Residents blamed the Ghaziabad Development Authority for the mess. “It shows the inefficiency of the GDA. All the roads were submerged and there was not a single patch of dry land,” said Ashish Kumar a resident of Supertech Apartment. However, GDA officials said work for laying sewer lines in Indirapuram was the cause for the pathetic condition of roads in the township. “The rain was unexpected and we are carrying out work especially in Ahimsa Khand due to which many stretches are dug up,” said RP Singh, executive engineer, GDA. Showers also left several parts of Indirapuram without electricity. “Power went off at 3am and in many pockets like in Ahimsa Khand, the supply was restored only by 3pm,” said Manish Chandra. The power department, however, attributed the outages to fault in underground cables due to waterlogging. “Apart from Indirapuram, there were reports of traffic jams from Mohan Nagar, Hapur Chungi and other city areas. But by afternoon, the situation was back to normal after the rain stopped,” said an official from the traffic department. ",,,,,,,,,,
Ghaziabad,"Private tutor, an 18-year-old boy, rapes and murders his six-year-old student","GHAZIABAD: An 18-year-old private tutor was arrested on Wednesday for the alleged rape and murder of his six-year-old student in Loni. The girl’s body was found on a vacant plot near her home on Tuesday morning, a day after she went missing. Police said Faizul Islam lured the girl out of her residence on the pretext of buying her an eraser on Monday night, took her to his house in the same locality and then raped and strangulated her. He had initially hid the girl’s body on the terrace of his uncle’s house where he was living, before dumping it on a vacant plot the next morning. According to police, the girl, a student of Class I, had gone missing from outside her home around 7.45 pm on Monday just after returning from her tuition classes. In fact, after putting her bag down, she had told her mother that she was coming back in five minutes as one ‘bhaiya’ was calling her outside. However, when she did not return after half an hour, the family members started looking for her. After the family raised suspicion on Faizul, police detained him for questioning on Tuesday itself. He subsequently broke down during interrogation and confessed to having raped and killing the girl, police said. “While looking for the girl, her father and other family members had gone to Faizul house on Monday night, but he feigned ignorance. He had even offered them to search his house. Notably, all that while the body was lying on the rooftop of the house in which he was staying,” said SP (rural) Arvind Kumar Maurya. He lived with his maternal uncle’s family. For the past few months, he had been giving tuitions to eight children, including three girls, on the first floor of the house. “During interrogation, he said he had been looking for a chance to sexually assault the girl for the past few days. And on Monday night, he got the opportunity as his uncle had gone to Rajasthan for some business-related work and his aunt and cousin left for a relative’s place,” the SP (rural) added. Police have added Section 376 (rape) of IPC and sections 5 and 6 of the POCSO Act in the FIR which was earlier registered for murder. ",,,,,,,,"1,10",,1

The accident took place early on Tuesday in Sector 3 of Raj Nagar. Vishant Verma sneaked out his father’s car from the family’s residence in Sector 3 after his parents and siblings fell asleep on Monday night. He neither knew driving nor possessed a driving licence. Nearly 400 metres from his home, the vehicle first crashed into an electricity pole, breaking it and then crashed into a tree 10 metres away. A security guard in the area called police after he spotted the car. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. The cops later informed Vishant’s family about the accident. “Vishant’s head was completely crushed in the accident and it took a lot of efforts to extract his body out of the car. His family members did not get the post-mortem done and cremated the body on Tuesday afternoon,” said Arvind Kumar, Raj Nagar Sector 3 police post in-charge. Vishant’s father Vijay Verma works as a pump operator at Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation’s Jal Kal department. The family stays in the department’s staff quarters in Raj Nagar. Vishant was the eldest among three siblings and would have turned 20 on February 20. “On Monday night, he took the car keys from his father’s jacket around 11.30pm and drove the car outside the house. While he was looking for the keys, his younger brother woke up and asked him what he was up to. Vishant said that he was going to drink some water and asked his brother to go back to sleep,” said a relative. He was quite excited about his birthday next month and had been asking every acquaintance to help him get a job at the earliest. It looks like he accidentally pressed the accelerator instead of brake as the vehicle hit the pole at a very high speed, said Vicky, one of Vishant’s friends. The power supply in the area was interrupted for more than 12 hours after overhead cables snapped in the accident. ",,,,,,,,,,

In a suicide note, Aarti Sachan claimed three teachers of St Mary’s Convent School in Shastri Nagar were targeting her son for the past one year over small issues while the SHO of Kavi Nagar police station and an official not only refused to lodge a complaint but also told her to end her life at home. Manoj Sachan, the woman’s husband, said his wife had consumed some 40 painkillers around 9pm on Wednesday and lost her consciousness. She was immediately rushed to a private hospital in Kavi Nagar, “where she is said to be out of danger now”. According to Manoj, the trouble started soon after the couple’s son was promoted to Class IV last year. “My son has been studying in the school for the past five years and we never faced any trouble. He has won several scholarships and medals in various co-curricular activities and Olympiad exams. We also did not delay in depositing school fees, and I am quite clueless why my son was being harassed by some school teachers,” he said. Manoj, an executive with a Noida-based private firm, said they had sent several notes in their son’s school diary, seeking an explanation from the three teachers for their behaviour but never got any reply. “Last week, my son was allegedly attacked by a girl with a compass and when he tried to raise a complaint, no attention was paid to it. Subsequently, Aarti had gone to the school on January 26 and tried to reason with the teachers but her effort like in the past did not fetch any results,” he alleged. When contacted, Sister Kathleen Augustine, the school principal, denied the allegations and said a girl from the same class had poked the boy with a compass after he pulled her hair, and instead of complaining the matter to the teacher who was present in the class, he went and complained to his class teacher who was teaching in another class. “He was told to apprise the matter to the teacher concerned, instead he went home and complained to her mother. The woman wrote a very offensive and threatening note to the class teacher and a few days later came to the school and attacked a teacher with a compass. She was also carrying a pair of scissors. We have even a lodged a police complaint in the matter,” the principal said. SSP Upendra Kumar Agrawal told TOI that SP (city) Shlok Kumar had called a meeting of both the parents and the teachers on Friday. ",,,,,,,,3,1,

Sahil Goswami, general manager of the hotel, said, “They were on their way to the hotel from Eros mall in Indirapuram when the two assailants on a motorcycle blocked their path and attacked them. Both were wearing helmets so Gaurav could not see their faces. One of them whipped out a gun and fired at Gaurav. The bullet hit him in the right hand. Even as the assailants could get ready for the second round, Gaurav turned his vehicle towards Indirapuram police station. The assailants did not follow him and fled towards Vasundhara.” Gaurav, however, did not go to the police station and took a U-turn and went directly to Narinder Mohan Hospital for treatment. Sahil said doctors removed the bullet in Gaurav’s hand after two and a half hours and discharged him. Sahil said he and Rahul went to Indirapuram police station and lodged a complaint around 6pm. Indirapuram SHO Nazir Ali said an FIR was being registered in the matter. Police sources pointed out several loopholes in the sequence of events. First, no one at the busy intersection heard or saw the attack on Gaurav. Second, Gaurav did not go to the police station even though he crossed it while trying to save himself from the attackers.

The boy, identified as Shivam, had left his home in anger around 6.30pm on Monday after reportedly being scolded by his mother for bunking school and not paying attention to studies. According to police, prima facie, it looks like Shivam, a student of Class III at a private school near his home, jumped from the ROB and fell near the tracks. Blood was oozing out of his eyes and nose and there was an injury on the back of his head. But there were no other injury marks on the body, said Atul Kumar Chauhan, New Bus stand police post in-charge.

His father works in a factory in Noida, while his mother works as a helper. Despite their poor financial condition, they sent all the three children to a private school,” said the relative. The police were alerted around 10 am on Tuesday. As the boy was wearing a sea-blue colour shirt with the logo of a prominent private school in Indirapuram, cops alerted the school about it. The school, in turn, contacted parents of students who were absent for the past couple of days. However, they later came to the conclusion that he was not a student of their school. Later, around 2pm, the boy’s father, Pappu, identified his body. Pappu said he was at the factory when his son left home in the evening. “After coming home, we launched a search to trace Shivam but could not find him anywhere.

Ghaziabad,"Man learns about wife’s affair, she murders him","GHAZIABAD: A woman allegedly killed her husband with the help of her lover after he came to know of their extramarital affair, and tried to portray it as a suicide in Loni. The crime came to light after the post-mortem report revealed that the man had been strangled to death. Both the accused were arrested on Friday. The accused have been identified as Razia (32) and Salim (29), both residents of Khoda colony. Razia was married to Ishraj Ahmad (34), a carpenter, with whom she has three children. Salim, originally a resident of Sambhal district, was friends with Ishraj. Indirapuram circle officer Ravi Kumar said Razia was involved in an extramarital affair with Salim for the past one year. “Razia used to give sleeping pills to her husband daily, but he did not realise that. After Ishraj went to sleep, she used to call Salim over to the house,” Kumar added. When Ishraj came to know about the affair in December, he confronted both the accused, who denied it. Ishraj then stopped talking to Salim and ordered his wife to do the same. The accused, meanwhile, started plotting to eliminate Ishraj. On the night of December 26, Razia mixed some sleeping pills in her husband’s food. After he fell asleep, Salim entered the house and the two strangulated him with Razia’s dupatta, with the intention to stage it as a suicide, cops said. “In the hospital, Razia told police and doctors that she was out for some work when her husband committed suicide. To police, she said when she returned home, she found that Ishraj had committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan. To fend off suspicion, she also told relatives that Ishraj was depressed lately as he was not getting much work,” a police officer investigating the case said. The post-mortem report, however, told another story. It ruled out suicide and stated that Ishraj been strangu lated by a dupatta. After receiving the report, cops started investigating the case. “The autopsy report revealed that it was a case of murder. Investigations revealed that Razia drugged Ishraj with sleeping pills and killed him with Salim’s help. Both the accused were booked under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC and arrested in Labour Chowk on Friday,” said Pradeep Tripathi, SHO of Khora police station and the investigating officer in the case. The duo was produced in a local court the same day, which sent them to judicial custody.

The mobile phone and motorcycle were stolen while the car belongs to Pramod’s relative. They were nabbed by a joint team of Kavi Nagar police and the crime branch at Hapur Chungi. The boy, a Class VII student, had gone missing from near his home on the evening of February 10. The boy’s father, Amit Arora, said his son had left home around 6.15pm to go to a stationery shop located in Sector 10 to buy a map but did not return home. His slippers were found just 100 metres from their house. As his parents put his photograph and their mobile numbers on social media seeking public help in locating him, they started getting calls from February 11. The fake ransom call came to the boy’s mother Neha. Pramod’s gang made the call on February 12 and sought Rs 2 crore. “I pleaded with both callers. I asked for some proof, but both refused. Later, when the second gang sent me a video clip of my son, I agreed to pay them Rs 10 lakh,” she said. “On the intervening night of February 14 and 15, I alone went to Akshardham flyover in Delhi and dropped the money at a pre-decided place. Two hours later, we were asked to go to a place near Delhi Public School in Noida Sector 37 and pick up our son. We were reunited with our son around 4.30 am on February 15,” Neha added. Neha said the fake ransom calls kept coming even after her son had returned home. The couple decided to inform police when Pramod’s gang called and said they would “remain in touch” with them.

Ghaziabad,Bodies of two missing siblings found in canal,"GHAZIABAD: The bodies of two siblings — a six-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl — were fished out from the Behta canal in Loni Border on Sunday morning. The siblings had gone missing from outside their house in Jawahar Nagar on Monday evening and a missing persons’ complaint was lodged the same day. However, police were late to take action in the case, said locals who took out a protest march on the Delhi-Saharanpur road which is close to the canal. As a result, traffic movement on the road was severely impeded for more than one hour. Laxmi According to police, Saurav and Laxmi were playing outside their house before they went missing around 4pm on Monday. Their father Raju, who is a scrap dealer, approached police about their disappearance. Their grandfather Pawan said the family, along with locals, made attempts to locate the missing children but could not find them. He denied any kind of dispute or enmity with anyone and said that the family had not received any ransom or threat call. Saurav The Behta canal is located only 100 metres away from the children’s house. Neighbours said that the bodies were first spotted by a local who was passing through the area. He alerted the others and soon police were informed. The bodies were subsequently fished out of the canal as hundreds of locals gathered at the spot. As soon as the bodies were identified to be of Raju’s children, an agitated mob took over the bodies and marched on the Delhi-Saharanpur road, raising slogans against police. A massive two-km-long traffic jam was witnessed in the area throughout Sunday afternoon. Senior administrative and police officials reached the spot and tried to pacify the protesters. Local BJP MLA Nand Kishore Gujjar also turned up at the spot and assured them that appropriate action would be taken in the matter. The children’s parents later agreed to hand over the bodies to police for the post-mortem. SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said that it was most likely that the children fell into the drain while playing but no one witnessed that. However, the post-mortem would reveal the exact cause of the deaths, he added. On the other hand, Ranjeeta Dhama, the chairman of Loni Nagar Palika has written a letter to UP irrigation minister Dharampal Singh, seeking a no-objection certificate for construction of walls on both sides of the canal. According to Dhama, in the past eight years, at least 30 people, many animals and even vehicles have fallen into the 3-km stretch of the canal which comes under the Loni civic body. “Agricultural land has shrunk over the years and colonies have come up in its place. Now, the canal is a threat to people living in its vicinity. The portion which lies in Delhi has already been concretised and barricaded. If the NOC is given, we can do so on this side too with the civic body funds,” Dhama added. Gujjar too had sought intervention of the irrigation ministry for renovation of the canal. He had written a letter in this regard on February 21. ",,,,,,,,,,

Ghaziabad,What RWAs plan to keep burglars at bay,"GHAZIABAD: From internal politics, defunct CCTV cameras to untrained security guards, there are many reasons for the rise in cases of break-ins in the city’s high-rise societies. The residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) have thought of some solutions to the problem. Several societies are now mulling either changing the private security firms they have hired or organising training for security guards so they are better equipped at spotting suspicious activities. RWAs are now planning to install CCTV cameras in each corridor of their buildings. Narendra Kumar Lal Das (63), president of Indirapuram’s Eastend Apartments RWA and the victim of the latest burglary, said, “Most guards from private firms lack technical know-how of securing a premise. They are often busy in doing all sorts of things, instead of implementing their core duty properly.” Das added, “After the burglary at my fourth-floor flat, I proposed that the RWA hire a new security agency, which has now been accepted in the general body meeting.” SP (city) Shlok Kumar said, “A slew of directions have been issued to apartment owners associations (AOAs) and RWAs to strengthen their security mechanism. Besides, residents can install anti-theft devices in their flats. Nowadays, police verification forms can be filed online. Patrolling during night hours has been enhanced, but AOAs should also come forward and plug the gaps in their society’s security.” Alok Kumar, president of Federation of Apartment Owners Association (Ghaziabad), also raised concerns about the spate of burglaries in high-rise apartments.  “Most societies do not have CCTV cameras installed in the building’s corridors, and burglars, with the aid of insiders, take advantage of this,” he said.

Shlok Kumar, SP, Ghaziabad City, told TOI that after getting a divorce, Geetika started staying with Deepak in his rented accommodation at Raj Nagar Extension.

Deepak told the police that she also started blackmailing him by saying she would file a rape case against him. “On March 8, the woman took a half-day at work and visited the accused person’s flat at Brave Heart Residency. In the society’s CCTV camera footage, both were seen entering the complex around noon that day. Later, they had a few drinks together. After some time, the woman asked Deepak about his marriage plans and their conversation turned into an argument. The woman then wanted to leave the flat and Deepak strangled her,” the SP said. “After that, the accused went to meet some friends in Noida around 3 pm. He also watched a movie with his friends.

Ghaziabad,"Man catches wife with lover, they kill him, dump body","GHAZIABAD: A 33-year-old man with a criminal record was allegedly murdered by his wife and her lover after he found them in an objectionable position on March 12. The two accused, along with a third accomplice, dumped the man’s body in the Hindon canal. A day later, to avoid suspicion, the man’s wife visited Vijay Nagar police station and lodged a missing person’s complaint. The woman, however, gave in to sustained police questioning and confessed to having murdered her husband, Ajay Nagar, with her lover Guddu’s help. Ajay’s body was fished out of the canal in Vijay Nagar on Sunday, based on information from his wife. While the woman has been arrested, her lover and the third accomplice, who helped them in disposing of the body, are untraceable. According to police records, Ajay had gone to jail several times in cases related to robbery and under provisions of the Gangsters Act. A year ago, when he was in a jail in Meerut, he met Guddu and became friends with him. However, after being released, Ajay shifted to Ghaziabad’s Siddharth Vihar and started running a transport business from Kirana Mandi. He lived here with his wife and two children. Guddu, police said, started visiting the victim’s house often and soon developed an illicit relationship with the latter’s wife. Around a month ago, he had even asked the woman to sever all ties with her husband. Subsequently, the woman had gone to her parents’ house in Nandgram and started staying with them along with her two children. Two days before the alleged murder, Ajay had taken his wife to Delhi for shopping. She came back to Siddharth Vihar on March 12. As Ajay would often return from work late, Guddu would frequent his house in his absence, police said. On March 12, however, Ajay came home around 10.15pm and found his wife with Guddu in a room. The third accomplice was also present in the house. An argument soon snowballed into a fight between Ajay and Guddu, and he, with the help of his accomplice, strangled the former. The trio then put the body in a gunny bag, took it in Guddu’s car and dumped it in the Hindon canal. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said a manhunt has been launched for the woman’s lover and the third accomplice. Read this story in Bengali",Love Affairs,,1,,,,,,,

Ghaziabad,"Ghaziabad: Killer engineer was a drug addict, says wife’s family","GHAZIABAD: Drug addiction, and not financial crisis, has been cited as the main reason by the family members of the 32-year-old woman who, along with her three children, was murdered by her software engineer husband in Indirapuram on Saturday night. The relatives claimed that Sumit Kumar’s annual pay package was Rs 14 lakh when the techie resigned from the Bengaluru-based company in December last year. Sumit (37) allegedly slit the throats of his wife Anshu Bala (32), a teacher with Mother’s Pride, sons Prathmesh (5) and Arav (4), and daughter Akriti (4) after giving them sleeping pills in their 2BHK flat on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. He then posted a video on the family’s WhatsApp group around 7pm on Sunday, informing them about the murders and saying that he would commit suicide. Till late on Monday evening, Sumit, who had left his flat around 3am on Sunday, was yet to be traced. Sources in the police said his location had been last traced to Ratlam district in Madhya Pradesh and six teams had been dispatched to various areas in search of him. Sumit has taken along his wife’s phone. The autopsy report has stated “haemorrhage due to ante-mortem injury” as the cause of Anshu’s and the children’s deaths. On the basis of the 2 minute 40 second video that Sumit had posted on WhatsApp, the owner of a medicine store has been arrested for allegedly selling drugs to the engineer. Mukesh Kumar, who ran Hukum Medical Store in Nyay Khand, had been accused by Sumit of fleecing him of over Rs 1 lakh. Sandeep Kumar Singh, the SHO of Indirapuram police station, said Mukesh had been running the store without a licence for the past several years.  It was from this shop that Sumit had recently bought medicines worth Rs 22,500, including sleeping pills for his wife and children. Anshu’s father Vaidyanath Singh, who was in Patna at the time of the murders, alleged that Sumit had been torturing her daughter and three kids for the past four years and would often resort to beating.  The woman’s brother Pankaj Singh, who has lodged a complaint against Sumit, claimed that the techie was addicted to psychotropic medicines and his family had come to know about it one and a half years ago. He also alleged that Sumit could have killed the four in a fit of rage after being denied money to buy drugs. “He would start trembling if he was made to stay away from drugs for a long time,” he claimed. “Sumit was quite violent by nature. Despite earning a good salary, he was always short of money. He would taunt my sister for giving tuitions at home. The kids, too, were quite scared of him,” Pankaj added. He further said the medicine store owner had taken advantage of Sumit’s forgetful nature and sold him psychotropic medicines at exorbitant rates. “At times, Sumit ended up paying Rs 5,000 for medicines worth Rs 100. It was because Anshu was in such misery that my father started staying with them and helping them financially,” he added. According to Pankaj, when the family came to know in March that Sumit had resigned from his job three months earlier, Anshu decided to shift to his native place in Jamshedpur to tide over the financial crisis. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said the GRP of neighbouring districts and states had been informed about Sumit and asked to share any information related to him. ",Unknown reasons,3,,1,,,,,,
Ghaziabad,Techie’s sisters seek ‘strictest’ punishment,"GHAZIABAD: The three sisters of software engineer Sumit Kumar, who allegedly killed his wife and three children on Saturday night, have demanded “strictest possible punishment” for him. Police are trying to trace Sumit, who has been missing since the murders, “dead or alive” across various locations in the country with the help of his elder brother Amit Kumar, who holds a senior position at an MNC in Bengaluru. The police said several teams had been dispatched to locate the techie. Sumit (37) allegedly slit the throats of his wife Anshu Bala (32), a teacher with Mother’s Pride, sons Prathmesh (5) and Arav (4), and daughter Akriti (4) at their 2BHK flat in Indirapuram. He had also posted a video on WhatsApp informing his relatives about the murders and telling them he was going to commit suicide. The guard of his housing society had seen him leave his flat around 3am on Sunday. He has been missing since. Sandeep Kumar Singh, the SHO of Indirapuram police station, said Sumit’s brother had been assisting them in their search for the engineer. “We have spoken to Sumit’s sisters and brother Amit in this connection. They are cooperating with us in the investigation,” he added. Anshu’s brother Pankaj Singh said Sumit’s three sisters — Guddi, Baby and Rinki — have sought strict punishment for the techie if he’s found alive. “They’re equally hurt and heart-broken. Guddi lives near Sumit’s house and would visit him almost daily. She was very close to them and had tried to dissuade Sumit from taking drugs after she came to know about it one and half years ago,” he added. Anshu’s family has claimed Sumit was addicted to drugs and blamed his dependence on psychotropic medicines for the murders. Sumit was out of job for the past four months. The family said Anshu had chanced upon strips of some medicines in Sumit’s possession. A search on the Internet revealed that the tablets were meant to treat anxiety and other related ailments that Sumit did not have, Pankaj added. According to Pankaj, Sumit had been planning the murder for quite some time. “He bought a big knife from an e-retailer company using his friend’s login ID between April 9 and 10 and told Anshu it was for the kitchen. I think the motive was to use it for the crime,” he said. “He must be hurt as he was dependent on his wife after losing his job. Anshu could not afford to support his addiction and would tell him to quit it. This must have frustrated him and led him to plan the murder,” he said. ",,,,,,,,,,

The mothers accused that the boy and his minor friend had been stalking five girls for the past one month. They would follow the girls and board the train from Sahibabad railway station and harass them throughout their journey to Kotwali, where the girls were enrolled at a government school. Three of the five girls are in Class X and two are in Class IX. Two of them are also sisters. The girls’ parents came to know about the harassment only after the girls expressed unwillingness to go to school. “The boys had been quite abusive. They would pass lewd comments all the time, ask us to sit next to them in the train, and when we didn’t respond, they would talk over their phones and discuss plans to abduct us,” a girl said, adding, “Initially, we did not give them much attention, but perhaps this made them grow bolder. After alighting at Ghaziabad railway station, they began following us to our school. We didn’t know how to respond to such behaviour.” The mother of one of the girls said she only came to know of the harassment last Friday, when her daughter refused to go to school. On prodding, she revealed the ordeal. Her friends, too, told their parents about the incidents. On Monday, the mothers boarded the train, along with their daughters, and kept a watch on their girls.

He was murdered by three youths from his locality who were bullied by him, police said. Kumar had allegedly thrashed two youths from the neighbourhood after getting drunk on Holi. He also used to often mock them. On April 27, after Kumar again thrashed one of them, the three youths hatched a conspiracy to kill him.

They tied Kumar and dumped him in the boot of their vehicle and drove to Kundli-Ghaziabad Peripheral Expressway at night. They took him out at an isolated spot and kept thrashing him for 20 minutes and then choked him to death. The killers disfigured his face with stones to make identification of the body difficult. Kumar’s mother informed police about the kidnapping around 6pm on April 28. In her complaint, she said that she and her son had gone to the market to buy milk and groceries. Kumar was standing outside the shop when two men dragged him into a car. She screamed for help, but no one came forward and the kidnappers sped away. Later, she identified one of them as Mohit from her neighbourhood. An FIR of kidnapping was registered at Narela police station. Mohit was found absconding from his house.

The girl’s body was found with strangulation marks on her neck on the roof of an under-construction building. Police said that the youth and the girl’s parents were labourers involved with the construction of a new block of Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC). More than 200 construction workers, including the youth and the girl’s family, have been living in a shanty near the building. Basant Sahu, the accused, found the girl and her two-year-old cousin playing outside their home on Wednesday afternoon. Police said that he took them to the roof of the under-construction building on the pretext of giving them some Rs 10 coins. There, he allegedly raped the nine-year-old and strangulated her to death, fearing she would reveal his identity to her parents. He then abandoned the toddler on the roof and went down to sleep in his room in the shanty. “The girl’s mother had gone to the local market at the time of the incident. She raised an alarm after she returned home and could not find the two girls,” said SP (City) Shlok Kumar. The parents and other labourers started looking for the two girls.

Ghaziabad,Ghaziabad: 13-year-old raped near home found to be 7 months pregnant,"GHAZIABAD: A 13-year-old girl raped several months ago has been found to be seven-months pregnant. The girl’s family, residents of Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad, had not approached police after the rape for fear of social stigma attached to it. “The girl was raped by an unidentified person around eight months ago but her parents remained quiet about it, fearing nobody would want to marry their daughter. A few days ago, she complained of severe abdominal ache. Her parents took her to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital in Delhi, where medical reports confirmed seven months’ pregnancy,” a police officer said. “The hospital had informed Delhi Police about the minor girl’s pregnancy. A report was sent to Ghaziabad police to lodged an FIR into the matter and take necessary action on it,” the officer added. Police are also probing why the parents failed to realise anything when their daughter was seven months pregnant. The girl’s mother said her daughter had told them that about eight months ago, the accused, a villager from the neighbourhood, had given the girl a drink laced with sedatives and forced her to consume it. He then abducted her and took her to an isolated plot in Khoda, where he allegedly raped her at least twice. “We were not aware about her pregnancy and only the doctor’s reports revealed that,” the mother said. “The girl had not seen her tormentor after the incident. He must have fled the village after the rape,” she added. The girl’s family insisted on an abortion, but a doctor examining the victim advised against it as there was a “risk involved”. “Child pregnancies are extremely dangerous and could lead to complications and even death. The bodies of young girls are not fully developed to carry a baby, and these pregnancies tend to be a high risk,” the doctor said. Satendra Prakash, SHO of Khoda police station, said a case under POCSO and relevant sections of IPC had been registered against an unidentified person. “Police are recording the statements of the family members. We’ll try to get some leads and catch the accused.” Aparna Gautam, circle officer of the area, said it was quite strange that the girl’s mother failed to realise that her daughter was pregnant. “After a couple of months, signs of pregnancy are quite distinct. It is strange that her parents were not aware of it. If any crime had occurred with the minor, police will file a case under relevant sections of the IPC and POCSO act. We will carry out a detailed investigation. The role of the parents will also be probed,” said Gautam. ",,,,,,,,"7,10",,1

Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Lokesh Kumar said, “Rachna’s relatives tried to intervene on several occasions to resolve the matter with her husband, but to no avail. In the meantime, Rachna gave birth to two daughters, but even that didn’t improve the situation.” Unable to cope with the torture, Rachna, on August 8, 2010, committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling. Later, an FIR under IPC sections 498A (domestic violence), 304B (dowry death) and Dowry Prohibition Act was registered against the three accused, at Modinagar police station, following a local court’s order, the ADGC said. However, the court during proceedings found evidence of IPC 306 (abetment of suicide) and not 304B. Altogether, nine witnesses were produced. Additional district judge Beena Chaudhary found the accused guilty of the crime and awarded the punishment. The ADGC said, “Under IPC 498A, the court handed down two years’ jail term to each accused, and also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. Likewise, under IPC 306, the court imposed six years and Rs 20,000, and under the Dowry Act, one year imprisonment and Rs 2,500 fine on each convict. All the jail terms will run concurrently.” The accused were out on bail all those years, the ADGC added. ",,,,,,,,"2,3,6",1,

Ghaziabad,"Defrauded, eight kidnap three conmen to recover Rs 56 lakh","GHAZIABAD: Eight men were arrested on Friday for allegedly kidnapping three youths who had cheated them of lakhs after promising government jobs to their family members. Posing as CBI and Army officers, police said, the kidnapped trio — Nirdosh Rana, a BPharma student, and Manoj and his elder brother Ajeet — had in November last year collected Rs 56 lakh from the eight accused on the pretext of providing their family members jobs in UP Police, railway police force and postal department. The eight — Vikram Singh, Anil, Rajkumar, Rahul, Sunil Kumar, Inder, Vivek and Rajkumar — planned the crime after they recently realised they had been conned by Nirdosh, Manoj and Ajeet over promises of government jobs and their repeated requests for refund were ignored by the trio. On June 19, police said, the eight drove to Manoj’s house in Kavi Nagar in two cars — a Swift Dzire and Eeco — where Sunil persuaded the two brothers to come out for a conversation. As soon as Manoj and Ajeet stepped out, the accused bundled them into one of the cars and drove out of the area. “The kidnappers soon forced Manoj to call Nirdosh on his mobile phone. They asked Manoj to pursuade Nirdosh to come to Vaishali metro station. Later when Nirdosh reached the spot, the eight bundled him into the other waiting car,” said Shlok Kumar, SP (city). Subsequently, the kidnappers used Nirdosh’s phone to call one of his neighbours. “They requested Parmanand Gupta to inform Nirdosh’s family members that he had met with an accident near Govindpuram. When Nirdosh’s parents reached the spot, the accused called them again and asked them to go to NDRF ground in Kavi Nagar,” Kumar said. But the ordeal of Nirdosh’s family members did not end there. “The kidnappers again called them, this time from Manoj’s phone, and demanded Rs 5 lakh within 12 hours for his release,” he said. Over the next 48 hours, the eight held Nirdosh, Manoj and Ajeet hostage in the two cars and drove them from one place to another. “While Manoj and Ajeet were driven around Delhi and Ghaziabad, Nirdosh was taken to Bulandshahr,” the SP (city) added. Police put the two mobile phone numbers on surveillance soon after Nirdosh’s parents approached them. “Based on inputs from our technical team, we nabbed the eight from a forest near Bapudham Road in the early hours of Friday. We have also seized the two vehicles,” Kumar said. During interrogation, the accused told cops that the trio had duped them of Rs 56 lakh on the pretext of providing government jobs to their family members. “The eight told us they had earlier lodged a police complaint against the trio. They also confessed to cheating 15 people in Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr in the past six months,” he added. The eight have been booked under Section 364A (kidnapping for ransom) at Kavi Nagar police station. “They were produced in a court and sent to judicial custody,” Kumar said. ",,,,,,3,,,,

Ghaziabad,"Jobless and suspicious of wife, man wipes out family before killing self","GHAZIABAD: A 37-year-old man allegedly killed his wife with a hammer and poisoned his three kids to death before committing suicide in Masuri early on Friday. The alleged murders come barely six days after a former official of a pharmaceutical company reportedly killed his wife and two children and hanged himself from the ceiling fan of their house in Gurgaon. Officers in Ghaziabad police said Pradeep had been unemployed for the past one and a half years and had turned alcoholic over time. His wife Sangeeta (32) worked as a nurse at AIIMS’s National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre here, and the couple had three daughters — Mansavi (8), Yashasvi (5) and Ojasvi (3). They lived with Pradeep’s father Feru Valmiki, who retired as a master chief petty officer in the Indian Navy, mother Sheela and sister Reena in a single-storey house in New Shatabadipuram. Police have recovered a six-page suicide note purportedly written by Pradeep, suspecting his wife of being involved in an illicit relationship. The letter also vividly mentions the way the woman and the three girls were murdered. Quoting the “suicide note”, SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said Pradeep first hit his wife on the head multiple times with a hammer and then forced the three daughters to drink poison. He wrapped their mouths and heads with a four-inch-wide black tape to ensure they did not blurt out the poison. Pradeep, too, wrapped his head with the same tape and drank poison. Police said when they entered the room, the bodies of Pradeep and his three daughters were found on the bed while Sangeeta lay on the floor. She was being rushed to a nearby government hospital as she was found breathing feebly, but died on the way. Ironically, the black adhesive tape used by Pradeep to wrap the faces of his wife and daughters was actually brought home by Sangeeta. It is used for containing violent patients undergoing treatment at hospitals. It was Pradeep’s sister Reena who first spotted the bodies. Reena told police she woke up around 4.30am and saw Pradeep lying on the sofa. Asked why he was not in the bedroom, Pradeep went inside but did not say anything. A little later, Reena heard cries of the three children and knocked on the door, but Pradeep asked her to go back saying he was just talking to them. Finding something amiss, Reena woke up her elderly parents and alerted neighbours. When she peeped inside the bedroom through a glass above the door, she saw the bodies lying on the bed. The police control room was informed around 5.40am. SSP Singh reached the house along with a team of senior officials. The bodies were sent for autopsy. Relatives said Pradeep would often accuse his wife of having an affair and had claimed that his daughters had been conceived through IVF. He was jobless for around a year and a half and would often come home drunk, which led to frequent quarrels with his wife. On Thursday too, Pradeep and Sangeeta had fought over delay in paying the electricity bill. A commerce graduate, Pradeep had taken admission in a foundation course offered by the Institute of Cost Accountants of India, but left it in the middle. A relative said Pradeep had told him he had landed a job in a private company and would join work in a few days. According to the man’s cousin, Ravindra Kumar, Pradeep and Sangeeta had met 12 years ago while working at a private hospital in Patparganj and fell in love. Pradeep worked there as a storekeeper while Sangeeta was a nurse. Sangeeta was originally from Ranchi, while Pradeep’s hometown was in Meerut’s Aghera village. “Pradeep doted on his three daughters and it was quite shocking to see the way he killed them. We had spoken on Thursday evening and he told me he would like to see me on Friday,” Ravindra said. On a complaint by Pradeep’s father Feru Valmiki, an FIR against his son was registered under IPC sections 302 (murder), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 307 (attempt to murder) at Masuri police station.

However, divers did not find her body despite hours of search. Later on Saturday evening, Komal’s father Anil Talan lodged the missing person’s complaint.

Police said the accused, Raeesuddin, was in an inebriated condition when he committed the murder. Raeesuddin, a daily wager, had married Shamshadi (30) a year back after giving divorce to his first wife. He has three children aged between two and eight years.

Ghaziabad,Delhi’s Gone Girl: Woman stages suicide to get husband arrested,"GHAZIABAD: “Have you arrested my husband?” When police finally got to the woman curled up under a blanket in a two-tier AC coach of Coimbatore Express at Bangalore City railway station late on July 8 (Monday), this was her only question. “Tell me, has my husband been sent to jail?” Komal Talan, the woman on the Bengaluru train, was 22 when Gillian Flynn’s page-turner, Gone Girl, first arrived at bookstores, and 24 when it was released, two years later, as one of the most anticipated movies of 2014. At 29, she could say she owns the title. Komal, a trainee manager with an insurance company on Barakhamba Road, disappeared on July 5 from her in-laws’ house in Delhi’s Pandav Nagar. A day later, her white Scorpio was found parked under the Hindon elevated road in Ghaziabad with a note saying she was “going away”, and accusing her husband and in-laws of torturing her over dowry since her wedding on April 20, 2018. The note and the car, parked right next to the Hindon canal, suggested she had committed suicide. Fake ID, new number and 4 cities: Cops finally bring back ‘Gone Girl’Divers were called to look for a body. Later, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) scoured the length of the canal, whose waters are still and mostly shallow. But this wasn’t the presumed last cry of anguish from a woman driven to despair. It actually was the final piece in months of planning by a woman who had channelled all her rage into quietly planning revenge against her husband for all the torture he had allegedly inflicted, a plot line straight from the pages of Flynn’s novel. For the first 24 hours of her disappearance, as divers searched the canal and police briefed news reporters on a possible suicide, the plot proceeded exactly as Komal had laid out. Her father, a Bharatiya Kisan Union member, filed a police complaint and a case was registered against her husband Abhishek Chaudhary, a bank executive, and her in-laws, at Indirapuram police station on Saturday night. They were charged with domestic violence and kidnapping under provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Police also detained Abhishek for questioning as Komal’s parents accused him of murdering her and throwing her body into the canal. This was the second FIR filed in two days — the first was a missing person’s complaint filed at Barakhamba Road police station on July 5, the same night she disappeared. Just as Komal had thought it would be: it did look like she had driven all the way to Hindon Canal from Pandav Nagar in east Delhi, and jumped. She had left home for office in the morning and never returned — her last location was Sahibabad, 6.45pm — and her SUV wasn’t found till the next morning. It gave Komal time. She switched off her phone, went to Anand Vihar, and took an overnight bus to Jaipur. From there, she bought air tickets for Mumbai. She used the name Kamakshi, an identity she had created through forged documents and a possibly forged Aadhaar card (still being probed). Her note, which she left in the SUV, had been discovered by then. And while divers looked for her body in the Ghaziabad canal on July 7, Komal sat back in the economy class of an airplane that cruised towards India’s west coast. On landing in Mumbai, Komal checked into a hotel and booked a berth, again as Kamakshi, on Coimbatore Express. She boarded the train from Kurla that night. She had no particular destination. All she wanted to do was stay away long enough for Abhishek to go to jail. But her plan was eventually blown by electronic surveillance. Komal, police said, was in touch with some friends using a different number. That’s how she was eventually tracked. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said, “She had deliberately parked her car near the canal so that police and her family assumed she had committed suicide. Her motive was to see her husband behind bars. She remained on the move to avoid detection and did not speak to her parents either. She also hid her real identity to buy tickets.” Kumar said police got an inkling of Komal’s plan when they spoke to some of her close friends. They soon discovered the number she was using and her new identity, Kamakshi. Investigators also found she had withdrawn her entire July salary, probably to fund her getaway. “She would have returned home after all the money she was carrying was exhausted,” said a police officer who was part of the investigation. A police team was formed to find her. It missed her train narrowly in Pune and eventually tasted success at Bangalore. A cousin of Komal accompanied the police team to identify her. Komal’s father Anil Talan claimed he had given Rs 41 lakh in cash and an Audi car as dowry to Abhishek, whose father Dharmendra Kumar is a sub-inspector in Delhi Police. Talan also alleged Abhishek’s family was demanding another Rs 21 lakh for starting a business for him. The Talans are based in Greater Noida. “We had not spoken to Komal on Friday and on Saturday evening. Dharmendra called me and informed me about the car being parked near Hindon canal and that Komal was nowhere to be found,” the FIR lodged by Anil Talan read. Talking to reporters after being brought to Ghaziabad on Tuesday, Komal alleged her fatherin-law abused her from the first day of marriage and would tell her he was the boss of the house and she couldn’t do anything without his permission. Asked about her getaway, she said, “I did not think much while leaving from here (Hindon canal). I did not know my destination. I did whatever came to my mind. The only thing which was clear was that I would never go back to my husband’s house. Even if my family asked me to go back for the sake of their social status, I would have not listened to them.” Police said charges of kidnapping would be removed from the FIR against Komal’s husband but the other sections would remain. Abhishek was arrested on Tuesday night, after Komal’s return, and will be produced before a magistrate on Wednesday. In that, her plan to see her husband behind bars has worked. ",,,,,,,,2,1,

The girl was returning home on a bicycle after school hours when she was stopped and assaulted by bike-borne molesters in Lambhua area of Sultanpur on August 8. The 16-year-old raised an alarm when the youths passed lewd remarks. Her screams drew a crowd and the bikers fled, said her family members.

Bystanders took her to the district hospital and informed her family. Talking to TOI, the girl’s grandfather said, “I shuttled between home and police station and pleaded with cops to register an FIR, but the Lambhua SHO paid no heed.” “On August 11, when the girl began to sink, she was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre in Lucknow.

The court acquitted the accused’s parents due to lack of evidence against them. Presenting his case before the court, additional district government counsel (ADGC) Sanjay Sahu stated that Waseema, sister of deceased Nazima had lodged the FIR on September 15, 2015. Nazima and Ravi Balmiki, after getting married, started living at Rawatpur in Kalyanpur police circle. On September 12, 2015, Nazima had gone to her parents’ house to attend her younger sister Afreen’s marriage scheduled for September 16, 2015. On September 14, 2015, Ravi went to his inlaws’ house, thrashed his wife Nazima and brought her back to his house, the prosecution told the court. Humiliated over severe beating, Nazima committed suicide by hanging herself from the roof of her room on September 15 afternoon. Waseema in her FIR stated that Ravi used to treat Nazima cruelly and often forced her to fetch money from her parents’ house. They had already given him Rs 25,000 twice. During arguments, the defence pleaded that Ravi and Nazima were not legally married and were living in live-in-relationship. But the court, after going through the evidence on record, rejected the live-in relationship theory and observed that this relationship also has the same object and it is common in high societies.

The ADGC stated that a complaint was filed by the victim’s father on July 14, 2010, against two persons--Ghulam Jilani and Farhan--alleging that they had enticed his daughter and alter kidnapped her at around midnight. The victim in her statement stated that she knew Farhan because he was studying with her in the same school and the same class and she would often help him financially.

Lucknow,"I was not raped, but the scars are no less: Bidita Bag in Lucknow","While the #metoo movement might have taken a back seat at the moment, people from the industry still have a lot of personal experiences to share about what happened with them during their struggling years. The latest to speak her heart out is actress Bidita Bag, who shot to fame with the film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz.' Bidita, who was in Lucknow recently, shared with us about the subject and how she dealt with a similar situation in life. ""I think after this #metoo movement, the industry has become safer for girls. I can very much relate to the pain of the girls because I have gone through that pain, the degree was less, as I was not raped, but the scars are no less. I have experienced harassment so many times in the industry. The first time it happened to me, I was too shocked to react as I considered that person to be my friend. This was four years ago and I had met this filmmaker and wanted to cast me in one of his projects that he was planning. He has also assisted Ram Gopal Verma in some films, so I found him genuine. Over time, we became friends and one day he took me to a party. On our way back from the party, he tried to molest me in his car. It came as a complete shock to me and I was flabbergasted as I was thinking that how can a person, whom I took as a friend, do such a thing? Aisa nahi hai ki main bhaag nahi sakti thi or I could not have slapped him. Of course I could as I am trained in martial arts, but after that whole incident, I was in a complete state of shock.""

Aaj se kuchh saal baad kisi ko yaad nahi rahega ki kya hua tha’. And I was just listening to his crap and imagining that is he the guy whom I took as a dear friend? He got married recently and have a kid but the way he was behaving I was like totally in a shock,"" says Bidita, adding, ""Aur aisa nahi hai that this was just one incident, there are many where men have just simply undressed in front of me! Yeh sab bahut baar hua hai mere saath. My friends tell me why don’t I report these people to the police or complain about it. But I tell them ki main kya karun? I am more worried about that filmmaker who just got married and has a small kid. Isliye it’s better to keep mum and move ahead in life. Today that filmmaker is nowhere. He is still struggling for that same film and look at me, I have reached a certain position in life,"" said she. A popular actress in Bengali cinema, Bidita believes that the entertainment industry follows the path of nepotism and new faces have to struggle a lot to get their first break in the industry. Elucidating more upon the statement, she said, ""See nepotism is there and one cannot deny that fact. Every year a star kid is getting launched. So it’s ok because they have parents who have worked their entire life to gain that fame, which they have now passed on to their children. Their children are more privileged in that way. But, after all, if they don’t have talent, they won’t last for long. For an outsider like me, it took me ten years to reach where I am today. I started at an early age of 16 and post 27, I got my first big success which was 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz.' But if I talk about the star kids, they are privileged right from their birth and have everything served on a platter."" Adding, she said, ""I think if you need to last long in the industry then you need to build your reputation. If you are not good at your job and you do not have a good fan following, good se I mean genuine fan following, then that actor will not last for long. Family plays a very important and big role, especially in the entertainment industry. They create that environment and ambience of basic training. Like mujhe toh bahut baad main pata chala that in order to be famous, one needs to have a fashionable and trendy wardrobe, good diction, proper training in various acting courses. But for star kids, I think they were told since childhood or probably they have grown up seeing that. Jaise doctor ke bache doctor hote hain, waise I think actor ke bache actor hote hain."" Making the conversation a bit light, we asked her about her stay in Lucknow this time, to which she said, ""I have stayed in this city for almost a month and trust me, the feeling was just wonderful when I came this time. People are so nice and full of warmth, and moreover, they have become shooting friendly. It’s because I think Lucknow has become more of a shooting place rather than a tourist place. Also, at one point of time, I felt that I am shooting in Mumbai as every other film is being shot here. It seems half of Bollywood is in Lucknow, shooting."" Dressed in a chikan suit, Bidita owned up to loving the embroidered cloth. ""I am actually fascinated by these beautiful chikan saris and suits. You know, I have a separate wardrobe for my chikan suits and saris. My friends come over to my place and say that I have such a lovely collection of chikan suits, to which I tell them that credit goes to Lucknow which gives me the opportunity to buy more and more of them,"" said she. — Prachi Arya ",,,,,,,,,,

Scared, Chauhan stopped parking her vehicle in the slot. TOI, in a reality check, has found there are many women like Chauhan, who avoid parking vehicles at the designated lots because they were dingy and unsafe. Arti Srivastava, a teacher, said, “I used to park my car at Gol Market. Once I was out with my 22-year old daughter and got late... few men who were drinking in the lot tried to waylaid us. We somehow managed to drive out but decided never to park inside again.” Rimjhim Tiwari, a housewife, recalled how once it was so dark in the parking lot with no lights around that she had to search for her car using a mobile phone torch. Tanya, a bank aspirant, who had parked her vehicle outside a mall in Hazratganj, said she has often seen boys passing inappropriate comments at women. “Eve-teasing is frequent at these parking lots,” she added. In Aminabad, Sanjana Verma, a teacher, who faced harassment at a parking lot, said women don’t complain about such behaviour and instead avoid going there. She recalled how some boys playing cards inside the lot started making obscene gestures at her and her friend recently. They called the attendant but he was of no help. “Calling police would have created a scene, so we decided to leave but never parked vehicle in the lot again.” Sushmita Dixit, at a parking lot near polytechnic in Gomtinagar, said, “We need parking lots reserved for women with deployment of proper security.” SSP Lucknow Kalanidhi Naithani told TOI that he will call upon a meeting with private security agencies and would instruct them to act more professionally. “I will also brief police outposts to coordinate with parking lots and conduct a regular checking, be it in the basement or outer space,” he added.

Lucknow,"72 hours after Krishnanagar dacoity and double murder, cops still clueless","LUCKNOW: Even after the lapse of 72 hours, police on Tuesday failed to get any breakthrough in the sensational Krishnanagar double murder and dacoity. The new angles being probed also failed to yield any result. Meanwhile, three more persons were detained for questioning. The police are now probing the murder motive in the case after an employee of RK Jewellers, who was detained for questioning, told investigators that attackers shot indiscriminately at everyone who came in their way. Circle officer, Krishnanagar, Lal Pratap Singh, said, “The detained employee told us during interrogation that attackers were shooting indiscriminately. The footage of CCTV cameras installed outside the shop also showed attackers firing at everyone who came in their way.” “ In dacoities, miscreants are more interested in booty, but here they were on a shooting spree, which suggests that the motive could be taking revenge from RK Gupta, owner of RK Jewellers showroom, for some old rivalry or to teach him a lesson,” Singh added.” On Tuesday, senior police officials interrogated gangster Avnish Tripathi, who is currently lodged in Lucknow jail for the kidnapping and murder of RK Gupta’s nephew Shyam Gupta. Until now, the police were probing Saturday’s incident as a dacoity case but now they are working on other theories such as revenge. Lucknow police said showroom owner RK Gupta was pursuing Shyam’s murder case. Hence, Tripathi could have nursed a grudge against Gupta and possibly attacked him. Police also said that Tripathi’s aides, Pawan Dubey, Tinku Kapala and Hemant Thakur, are also accused in the same case and were being interrogated. Shyam Gupta, 21, was kidnapped from Alambagh and later shot dead in 2008. His body was recovered from Jahangirabad area of Barabanki. The family had initially named some of Shyam’s friends in the case, but later the role of notorious criminal Avnish Tripathi and Pawan Dubey cropped up during investigation. The two were arrested in 2009 in connection with the murder. However, Tripathi escaped from police custody but was later arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force in 2018. Dubey was convicted for Shyam’s murder and is serving life imprisonment in Lucknow jail. The motive of this murder was ransom, claimed police. Crime branch officials said Tripathi had committed three murders, including Shyam’s, three loots and two dacoities in Lucknow. “In all these cases, sophisticated weapons were used. Shyam was also shot thrice with 30 bore bullets. And PWD junior engineer Masood Alam Siddiqui was shot dead using another sophisticated weapon,” police said. Aides of Tripathi — Kapala and Thakur — were also involved with him in the past cases. SSP Lucknow Kalanidhi Naithani said, “We are not ruling out the possibility of Tripathi’s involvement in the murder. His aides are also lodged in jails of other districts.” RK Gupta, who was shot at by dacoits, is till under observation in the hospital, said Gupta's brother Rajdesh. ""If his condition does not improve we will shift him to Delhi for treatment,"" he added Armed dacoits had shot dead two persons and injured two others when they attacked RK Jewellers showroom in Krishnannagar on Saturday.

Lucknow,Recover BBAU ex-VC payout: HRD,"Lucknow: Union ministry of human resources and development (MHRD) has directed Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU) vice-chancellor Prof Sanjay Singh to make recovery of undue payments of over Rs 65 lakh to former V-C Prof RC Sobti. It has also asked for strict disciplinary action against officers responsible for releasing the payment against rules. In the letter (TOI has a copyof it ), MHRD said that it had directed BBAU registrar RB Ram on January 21, 2019 to recover payments made as pay allowances and terminal benefits to Prof Sobti, but in his reply dated February 22, 2019, the registrar said the dues should be recovered by Panjab University where he served as professor and was drawing pension. Declining the argument, MHRD further said that the registrar RB Ram, while holding additional charge of finance officer in April 2018 had released the payments to Prof Sobti in violation of rules, which amounts to favouritism on his part. “Since huge undue payments have been made by the university itself, therefore, this stand is not acceptable and it is incumbent upon the university to recover all the undue payments made to Prof Sobti,” it said. The MHRD further pointed out that Prof Sobti drew full salary entitled to him as V-C during his term in BBAU along with pension from Punjab University from where he retired after serving as professor. In addition, BBAU released payments of Rs 26.27 lakh as gratuity, leave encashment and central provident fund which were against BBAU Act and Government of India rules. BBAU V-C Sanjay Singh said that action will be taken as per rules. Meanwhile, registrar RB Ram said, “I have not officially received the document, and will reply when I get it.” ",,,,,,,,,,

The audacious abduction and assault created ripples after it was reported in TOI and other newspapers and the SC had taken cognisance of the TOI story and sought a report from the UP government. Admitting to the incident inside Deoria jail, the state government said Ahmed was shifted to Bareilly district jail after the incident as an inquiry found the jail superintendent and other officials complicit in allowing the don’s goons to take the businessman inside the prison cell. Ahmed is facing 109 cases of which 17 are for murder, 12 under UP Gangsters Act, eight under Arms Act and four under UP Goondas Act. The inquiry report said Ahmed and his gang had been pressurising Jaiswal to part with money and his refusal had led to his abduction and assault before the jailed don. “During interrogation, jail staff and prisoners denied the assault but a joint team after inquiry found that some CCTV cameras inside the jail premises were tampered with and persons meeting with Ateeq Ahmed had been granted relaxation in violation of rules,” the report said. Amicus curiae Vijay Hansaria and advocate Sneha Kalita informed a bench led by CJI Ranjan Gogoi that according to the Allahabad HC report, several cases were pending against Ahmed for a long time without charges being framed by trial courts. The report said disciplinary action was initiated agai- nst two guards and a deputy jailor of Deoria jail for allowing unauthorised entry of Ahmed’s goons along with the kidnapped businessman. Acting as amicus curiae in a PIL filed by Ashwini Upadhyay that sought expeditious trial of accused politicians, Hansaria had brought the incident of abduction and assault to the SC’s notice.

TOI also visited Niralanagar, Kaiserbagh, Jankipuram, New Hyderabad and Yahiyaganj, where complaints were common. Sumit Dixit, a resident of New Hyderabad, said: “Stray dogs chase vehicles at night, often causing accidents.” Shobha Asthana of Niralanagar said the nuisance had increased owing to negligence of LMC authorities. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi told TOI that though Vrindavan Colony did not fall under LMC, a civic team would soon be sent to herd away stray cattle. Stray animals have always been a bane for the city. Besides attacking people and leaving roads filthy, they often lead to traffic bottlenecks and accidents. The government had in January directed the LMC to free the city of stray cattle in 100 days. According to records, only 2,000 such bovine animals out of an estimated 6,000 have been caught and sent to shelters.  With inputs from Simran Mangalani, Sanchita Singh ",,,,,,,,,,

In his complaint, the victim’s father alleged that the girl was returning from her coaching class on June 17, when three youths intercepted her to inquire about an address and later assaulted her. “They abducted her to an isolated under-construction shop. She was rescued by passers-by when she raised an alarm,” he said. Later, the girl returned home and narrated the ordeal to her father. Her father alleged that he went to lodge a case against the accused but the SHO refused to oblige. “Undeterred, my daughter decided to go along with me to the police station again on June 19 to lodge a named complaint against the youths but the SHO only gave an assurance,” he said. The next day, “I again went to meet the SHO to inquire about the case but he told me that he has warned the perpetrators to not repeat such an offence and let them off... My daughter could not bear this humiliation and committed suicide,” he added. Priyadarshi told TOI that after getting a complaint from the victim’s father, he sought a report from the CO Bilgram. “Prima facie, it has come to fore that the SHO sat on the complaint and did not lodge an FIR. He did not inform seniors despite a clear instruction and hence SHO Madhoganj was suspended. A probe has also been ordered into the incident by a Dy SP rank officer,” added Priyadarshi.

While confirming sequence of events, Faizabad SSP, Ashish Tiwari said, ""The two aides of slain pradhan were referred to Lucknow as their condition was critical."" On why police did not heed Yadav's complaint, the SSP said this will be probed and action will be taken against the guilty. ",Personal Vendetta,,1,,,,,,,

The 22-year-old survivor could come out of the hell within her own house and save her 14-year-old sister with the help of Asha Jyoti Kendra, which she approached on August 11. On Sunday, members of the Aasha Jyoti Kendra, with the help of police, rescued the survivors from their house. The complainant went back home while her sister was sent to government shelter home as she is a minor. SHO Sachin Singh said the father had been booked for rape, causing miscarriage without a woman’s consent and criminal intimidation, and also under the POCSO Act. Archana Singh, in charge of Asha Jyoti Kendra, said the survivor told her that she was being raped since the tender age of six. “Her mother knew about it all along and used to give her contraceptives and medicines to abort pregnancies. She told me that she had accepted the torture as her destiny but could not tolerate it when her father started molesting her younger sister,” Singh added. “The younger survivor told us that her father had been molesting her for the last three years but every time her elder sister intervened and saved her from being raped. Recently, their father became more aggressive and even started writing them sexually explicit letters,” she added. Read this story in Bengali“The complainant said that their two brothers (aged 18 and 8 years), the tenant in their house and some of their relatives knew about the actions of her father but no one opposed it. Finally, she mustered courage and narrated everything to her principal who then asked her to contact Asha Jyoti,” Singh said.

The murder sparked off angry protests in the city. Kamlesh received a call around 11 am and an hour later and two saffron-clad men walked up to his first-floor office.
