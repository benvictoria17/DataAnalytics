STEM Career Change,5,swvi7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/swvi7j/stem_career_change/,6,1645341433.0,"I’m currently working as a field biologist for fisheries research, and am looking to transfer into a more data-science oriented career field. I’ve grown tired of the field work side and love the data side, while most of my coworkers are the opposite.

I have a M.S. in Environmental Science, with coursework in single and multivariate stats, although I don’t use very much complicated math in my job. I have more experience than most of my early-career coworkers with R, and do use it at work, but am light years behind the statisticians in my office. No experience in Python, SQL, or any other data science software. 

My questions would be:

1. What skills would I need to gain / build on before making the switch? 

2. What’s a reasonable entry salary? Biologists don’t make great money so almost anything would be an increase haha.  

3. Are online courses / certifications worth it? The amount of marketing I see for those is insane. 

I luckily have access to large amounts of data and free time to learn new skills at my job, so I just want to make sure I’m on the right path. Thanks in advance!",2022-02-20 09:17:13

You can be a great programmer but SW engineering goes beyond that.   

With DS as with SW engineering you'd want to think end-to-end starting with strategy around what the DS folks should be doing.   Then there should be thought/discipline given to requirements, design, data (that whole space really), solid piplines, versioning (of code and data + lineage), testing, metrics, etc. etc.   

In my company there is way less discipline in the DS space than there is in typical SW engineering spaces.

An example could be gaming? I saw one post of a guy who did an analysis on cheaters in Rust.  Or perhaps you like ice hockey and want to see what factors contribute to a team going to the playoffs? I myself did an analysis on Formula 1 races and I did a comprehensive analysis on what makes people rate a specific race higher than others.

Comment,1,hxf49yb,,0,1645168942.0,"This is an interesting problem. I'm curious if the following approach would make sense in this context:

* Cluster the entire dataset and identify an optimal number of clusters for the documents (i.e. using internal validation)
* Look at where your labeled data fall into those clusters
* If there is one or a few clusters for which you do not have any labeled data, sample a reasonable number of points from those clusters and manually label them
* Treat the problem as a classification analysis from hereon

Don't think this fully solves the problem, but may be a decent workaround. You'd likely have some low-pop classes that don't justify a separate cluster and therefore wouldn't be captured, but this would hopefully only be a small number of the documents. We can also increase the number of clusters to potentially find a few more of these low-pop classes as well.

Hopefully that helps. Feel free to ignore if it doesn't make sense :)",2022-02-18 09:22:22

Comment,14,hxeqhnv,,0,1645160151.0,"I like the other answer with the data pipeline but I’ll give my own answer as well. Note: this is kinda long but you really only need one great project instead of 3 half assed ones.

Get data (clean or messy) from either a google research or scrape your own but that’s an extra step, write a script to clean data, perform some ml (nothing crazy), test thoroughly and document this process since it’s better to tell an interviewer how you evaluated the model instead of the actual results, and output the prediction to some kind of web app or email or something that makes it more user friendly (flask and stream lit are your friends here)

An example is like let’s say there’s a website that takes as input a picture of you, and returns to you its estimated age. Bad example but you get the point. This is what the end product should look like. You have a trained model in the background that takes input, and returns its output back to the browser. This can go a long way since you can demo very quickly during an interview. 

Also, focus more on getting a skeleton pipeline first. Then focus on each step.

Comment,1,hxeoi1s,,0,1645159081.0,"> My third thought is ""that looks about as easy as doing the same stuff in matlab.""

As I asked, please try it and show me. Please look at the image at the end first to make sure you understand what the actual result is. The groupby operations are going to be ugly in MATLAB, and the final plot, one line of Python code, is easily dozens of lines of MATLAB code at least. You will probably need to create an entire GUI to reproduce that one line.

> I have no idea how easy or hard any one of these is in Python. 

Trivially easy.

First, `aviinfo` is deprecated and will be removed from MATLAB, so better not to use that.  The replacement `videoreader` does not appear to dump all metadata in a single command.

But here is how I would do this in Python:

    import json
    from pathlib import Path
    import pandas as pd
    import imageio as iio

    vid_data = pd.DataFrame(Path('Videos').rglob('*.mp4'), columns=['path'])

    # This could be one line, I am making it easier to read
    vid_data['name'] = vid_data['path'].apply(lambda x: x.name)
    vid_data['size'] = vid_data['path'].apply(lambda x: x.stat().st_size)
    vid_data['date'] = vid_data['path'].apply(lambda x: x.stat().st_mtime).astype('datetime64[s]')

    vid_data['matches'] = vid_data[['name', 'date', 'size']].isin(vid_data2[['name', 'date', 'size']].to_dict()).all(axis=1)
    vid_data['changed'] = ~vid_data['matches'] & vid_data['name'].isin(vid_data2['name'])

    vid_data_good = vid_data[~vid_data.matches]
    vid_data_good['vidinfo'] = vid_data_good['path'].apply(lambda x: json.dumps(iio.get_reader(x).get_meta_data()))

    vid_data_good.to_sql('new_files', db)

I'll admit I am cheating a tiny bit. Imageio is part of anaconda, but to read video requires one additional package installed that isn't part of anaconda: imageio-ffmpeg. But this has *zero* dependencies, requires zero work to get working, and cannot cause any of the conflicts or other issues you describe. It merely exists to avoid forcing people to install ffmpeg if they don't want it.

If that really bothers you so much you can use `cv2.VideoCapture` to get the metadata, too, and it is installed by default. But it doesn't give everything in one command (note again that MATLAB's `videoreader` doesn't either), so I pretty much always use imageio.

Note also that there are other ways to work with the paths. You can use `glob` to get the paths as strings, then `os.path.getmtime` and `os.path.getsize`. Python has actually had the sort of recursive searching you just showed forever, MATLAB only got it within the last couple of years.

I prefer pathlib for working with paths, since it combines nearly all path operations in an extremely simple interface, one MATLAB doesn't have. So I could do `(targdir / 'subdir').rglob('*.mp4')` if I wanted to search the directory ""subdir"". MATLAB has nothing like PathLib, which makes working with paths much more of a chore in MATLAB. 

For more complicated directory searches, Python has `os.walk`, which loops over files recursively, and lets you interactively cut out subdirectories you don't want as you go. It is extremely useful for more complicated directory processing, and is something MATLAB doesn't have anything similar to.",2022-02-18 06:38:01

No no no. The reason you are good at A at all is because you are a master of B and it overlaps into A, not the other way around.

In other words, going deep on something builds stronger fundamentals. And the relationship is one sided: focusing on fundamentals doesn’t take you deeper. And in most cases you really don’t learn the fundamentals as well because you learned them out of context.

Correlation isn’t causation, ironic for a data scientist to get so wrong.

All building fundamentals explicitly does is, well, build fundamentals.

Yea this is also what I feel but theres a huge problem that in the industry, Biostatisticians are almost exclusively doing boring SAS stuff for clinical trials and dealing with regulatory guidelines. Its not fully technical like ML or stats is ironically even though its titled “biostatistician”. Just do a LI search for Biostatistician and you unfortunately end up seeing how the field is percieved by outsiders as “regulatory FDA monkey” stuff

The people doing that sort of work are titled as “ML research scientists”, or “bioinformaticians”, and not “biostatisticians”. Its honestly all artificial-id consider them statisticians too but the market labels biostatisticians when essentially the job function is glorified medical writing. The most complex stats I did in a Biostat role was a univariate linear mixed model. 

Thats sort of why even with a Biostat degree I went to DS p>>n omics and now I want to transition out of tabular data cause I am getting bored of computing millions of p values, and rebranding myself as an ML/AI person even as a statistician.",2022-02-18 00:49:57

Comment,5,hxd7yc0,,0,1645135699.0,"The optimization method is not what determines if its statistical or not. You can use GD to minimize say y=x^2 if you wanted to which would only be calculus-there is no random component. 

The stats comes in the formulation of the negative log-likelihood function itself that you are minimizing. Basically how you go from n data points (xi,yi) where xi is itself a vector to setting up the optimization problem. You assume a certain distribution, take the log and sum it and then obtain the log likelihood of the data given parameters.

ML just doesn’t assume a parametric form for y=f(x). Its nonparametric/nonlinear stats. All the other assumptions are still baked into the loss function (and potentially some regularization terms). When you use a ConvNet, you are assuming that pixels nearby are correlated for example, which enables parameter sharing.

A “non statistical” model would be something like a diff eq that describes the system deterministically. Neural nets are still formulated based on maximization of log-likelihood and therefore are statistical models.",2022-02-18 00:08:19

I have a master's and almost 5 years of experience in DS (ML and analytics) in a mid-sized company. Over the holidays I wanted to start looking for a new position so I started cold applying for Senior Data Scientist roles and turned on #opentowork on Linkedin. 

When I got back from the holidays, I had emails back from almost every application I've sent in, in addition to recruiters messaging me on LinkedIn. I thought, shit this is awesome and should be an easy switch, especially in the current job market... So just last week and this week, I went through \~10 recruiter phone calls, with all of them translating into a hiring manager interview or a technical screen which are scheduled for this week and next week. 

But, this is where imposter syndrome kicks in. Because DS interviews are known to differ from company to company, and even within teams of the same company, I figured it'd be best to ask the recruiters how I can best prepare for each of HM interview or tech screen. Some tell me Statistics, others tell me SQL, others tell me Python, and others tell me ML concepts. Sometimes they tell me it's all of the above. Yes, a data scientist should be fluent in most of these, especially with my level of experience, but if you ask me random textbook questions, how am I supposed to pull it out of my ass? What if I haven't used an algorithm in years? Some expect that I come prepared to answer Leetcode questions for an interview that's happening next week. Some don't even feel inclined to reply to my emails. 

I don't know how you all make the time to interview and actually get competitive job offers. I feel so underqualified and incompetent, even with years of experience in this field. To be transparent, I think I'm so scared of embarrassing myself in an interview.

However, I might have missed the progression in model deployment and data engineering skills. Furthermore, using only R might also contribute to the (potential) problem.

From Descriptive to Prescriptive Analytics,8,rcf5yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rcf5yp/from_descriptive_to_prescriptive_analytics/,6,1639046778.0," Hi, guys! I currently work for a BI platform as a project manager. Recently, we have been contacted by a potential client who asked us to come up with a simple optimization solution based on the concept of prescriptive analytics (see the pic below). He gave us an example of the company that existed a few years ago which did just that (the name - **MondoBrain**): a business user can upload a dataset (e.g. excel file) and then with the help of fairly easy interface optimize the KPI he is interested in. Our CEO doesn't really believe in the idea but asked us to do the research - he thinks there is nothing simple about optimization, because if it was simple, everybody would be doing it. I get the appeal of this idea: it's simple, supposed to be fairly affordable, no need to write code or be a professional DS.

I have a few questions for you:

1. How do you understand the term ""Prescriptive Analytics""?
2. Do you think it is possible to create a simple optimization solution?
3. Do you know any companies that might be doing that already? (I don't mean big companies like IBM or AIMMS because of course they are investing heavily in AI and ML; and their solutions are complex)
4. If you have had actual experince of working with products based on Prescriptive Analytics, please share.

P.S. the companies we researched: **RapidMiner** \- searches for optimal points in feature space, using a predictive model for target variable; the results are single points; no significance level in out-of-box version, outlier detection can be used to filter results.

**Gurobi Optimization** \- based on mathematical programming, different models that could be written in any language. Expensive and complicated, but shows real results across different industries.

Wanted to thank everyone in advance for sharing their expertise!

Got $900 CAD scammed out of desperation while searching for an entry-level data analyst job,179,rcbdp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rcbdp7/got_900_cad_scammed_out_of_desperation_while/,107,1639030328.0,"So yesterday I received an email that says my resume seems to be a good fit for the company as a data analyst which turns out to be a company that pretended to be ""AthletesCAN"" (a real company that has a website that appears in the top Google search) . I did a bit of the research and found out that for some reason I cannot find any job posting in Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and indeed. I had a hunch that it may be a scam but I was blinded by desperation, thinking it was probably a start-up company, which may not have job posting updated.

So the ""HR lady"", who went by the name ""Georgina Truman"", has a LinkedIn profile associated with the real company and appears to be a real person, and she texted me about the interview held on Dec 8 2021. Seeing that everything about her on the surface seems to be legit, I got tricked thinking that ""HR lady"" = Georgina Truman. Then she sent me an email, from a different email that approached me last time, required me to add her in Skype with the provided Skype cid.  I then searched up her name on Skype and there were more than 5 results with the same profile picture, same name, but different Skype cid. I thought ""It must be for security/privacy reason that she had so many Skype account"" I thought, so I got confused by a little bit but still asked her to send me the current Skype cid that she was using. She then added me directly and started talking about the scheduling of the interview.

&#x200B;

So just 30 mins before the interview, I was doing a written form of interview with another company that has different interview questions posted on the website under [this domain name](https://www.jotform.com/). This written form of interview is a little bit unusual experience that makes me think the next session that I had with the HR lady was normal, because she said it was gonna be a text based Q and A interview on Skype chat.  About 30 mins after the interview, she informed me that I got hired, and she will need me to print, sign and scan the offer letter.

&#x200B;

After that, she sent me a $1k CAD check and asked me to scan it with my RBC app, saying that it is for purchasing some ""training material/software"" as well as some home office upgrade/improvement. I scanned the check and $1k got deposited, and I was blinded by my inner happiness and thought ""Money is at my hand now, it is probably not a scam"". Then she proceeded to tell me to immediately go out and buy Apple gift cards from the stores on a list that she said the company has made deals with. Thinking that if not being ""proactive"" with the job my offer will get rescinded,  I immediately followed her exact instructions and went out shopping ASAP. When I tried to purchase the first gift card with the debit, it could not proceed(turns out it was due to the protection of fraudulent transaction due to check bounce back), so I thought ""maybe $500 is the limit this debit card can handle"", so I proceeded with the credit card and also purchased the rest of the $400 Apple gift card. 1 hour from the last purchase when I was trying to figure what happened with my locked online banking and debit card, and the truth revealed....

&#x200B;

I was too naïve, desperate for job(being jobless for more than half a year, having credit cards almost reaching the limit), and fell for this obvious trap that I for some reason kept finding reasons to justify my thought process.  Don't be like me, and pay extra attention to the job offers whenever they ask you to spend your money after depositing a check to you.

Hopefully I can get a job within a month to start paying back the credit card debt before it reaches the max limit.

&#x200B;


EDIT (2021 Dec 09):

Another potential scam here(I did not fall into this one):

So I got an email with an offer letter that told me to add ""Lindsey Blake"" in Telegram to proceed with the training session of ""Massive Insights."" She called herself ""IT and Setup specialist from Massive Insights"" And I checked that she was an employee until six months ago and now is with the new company.

If she is not doing a part time job in ""Massive Insights"" or there is no another employee who happens to bear the name of ""Lindsey Blake"" working in ""Massive Insights"", then it is probably another identity theft trying to scam people.",2021-12-09 08:12:08

Geographical location plays a major role, but you can see there's a $60k difference in mean salaries between dentist and data scientist.

You can see from [annual salary thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/re46xx/official_2021_end_of_year_salary_sharing_thread/), most do not break $150k. Of those that does, they are usually in norcal, long tenure, or by stock compensation. If you're not in ""major states"", you may not even break $100k.

It's true that data scientist has a much higher ROI so lifetime earning wise, DS is likely better.

That's assuming you do end up becoming a data scientist. When you finish a master degree in data science, there is a significance chance that you will not be a data scientist. When you finish dentist school, you will become a dentist.

(obviously I'm a data scientist and not a dentist so my understanding of the dentist side is not going to be so accurate).",2022-02-19 01:37:44

Comment,1,hxi7197,,0,1645223115.0,"I will say this: a small company with a great culture is one of the best jobs you're going to find. Sure, there are downsides - and you've highlighted the right ones - but those are not hard to overcome.

If you're struggling with mentoring/feedback, look for mentoring opportunities elsewhere. If salary/benefits are low, do keep in mind that sometimes higher pay comes with shittier work.

Large companies have their benefits, but I will argue they have an order of magnitudes more problems. 

* It's easy to get caught in a role where you spend 80% of your time dealing with processes/people instead of being able to focus on DS.
* It's easy to find really, really toxic people who are untouchable.
* It's easy to find coworkers that just straight up suck at their job.
* Everything is difficult. Need permission to a system? May take a month. Need a new laptop? May take 3 months. 
* HR's fundamental job is to prevent compensation from becoming too big a line item for the company. So there is an entire function full of people saying dumb shit like ""money is not the reason why people work here"". 
* Making any type of progress normally involves displacing deeply entrenched behaviors
* Also, resolving even the most minor of problems often requires lifting the carpet to find literal cadavers hiding underneath. ""We want to calculate average sales price"", oh cool, let me explain to you all of the 8473 exceptions that we have for calculating sales price that are all rooted in logic developed by someone who has since died. Good luck.
* Making any type of substantial change required literally 20 meetings. Like, anything that would move the needle - 20 meetings minimum. Maybe 50, who the fuck knows. 

Now, here's the one thing I will say: if you are *ever* going to work at a large company, then eventually you'll want to take that plunge to learn some of the skillsets you need to survive in those environments. But - and this is just my personal opinions - large companies come with more bad than good most of the time.

Having said that - the one big challenge of small companies is that all it takes is for the cofounder(s) to have a change in philosophy that you don't agree with, and the culture can go out the window in a minute.",2022-02-19 00:25:15

The dental schools I've gotten into are pretty expensive and looking at about 400-550k in debt.  
The masters is not very expensive and is just 10 courses so can finish in 1.5 years. Main thing is that idk if dental school is worth it I'm going to end up with a 150k salary which i could achieve in data science as well without as much debt and effort. I do like dentistry but I cant say im in love with it.

Comment,3,hxi05jt,,0,1645220347.0,"Which Masters of Data Science from UT? There are several programs at UT that could sort of match that criteria, so a bit more info would help.

Generally speaking: your prospects after a MS in DS are going to be somewhat dictated by what your undergrad was. If you're someone that already came in with 4 years of computer science experience, or 4 years of stats then your prospects after graduation will look very different vs. coming from 4 years of no math whatsoever. And then everything in between.

What jobs will it open up? It all depends - how well do you interview? How well are you able to demonstrate your skills through personal projects? Do you land an internship?

I would say generally speaking, an MS in DS that doesn't involve research will most likely not be the type of job that lands you a super cutting edge DS job. It's more likely to land you an entry level DS job doing more generic DC work.

There are some hard skills that are handy in this process. You mention version control, which is a skill that will never hurt to know really well. I also suggest learning a few different programming languages. You don't need to be an expert by any means, in fact you can be functionally illiterate.

A DS in a company may be doing the  job of a Data Analyst, and a DS in another company may be doing DS tasks + DE + SWE. So it's really depending on the situation. 

If I were to give advice it would be: 

1. Refine your basics in statistics, ML, DL, Python, algorithms, etc. You can check Andrew Ng's material on Coursera and [Deeplearning.ai](https://Deeplearning.ai), it's interesting
2. Pick a DS subfield that interests you and start reading and researching it. For me it's NLP. You can also work on a personal product-oriented project. This will allow you to pick up skills and knowledge on your journey.",2022-02-18 21:31:50

Comment,10,hxhf06j,,0,1645211919.0,"Yup, I'm a big fan of Holoviews. Being able to export graphs to html and send to business users (without having to host a server or worry about Tableau licenses is a big plus). They seem to be wowed by having mouseover annotations or being able to zoom/drag, even though that is mostly fluff to me (but if they like it, who am I to argue). But having sliders/dropdowns in HoloMaps is really nice. That's not to say that Tableau/PowerBI/whatever don't have a place for enterprise use cases... but if I'm just emailing some sort of adhoc analysis, Holoviews is phenomenal.

I also much prefer the API to matplotlib, and the Holoviews reference gallery is much more intuitive. The downside is that it's not very pythonic in that there can be tons of ways to do things (give it a pandas Dataframe, or a list of tuples, or a Holoviews dataset object, etc.). I just stick to always using pandas dataframed and I generally don't have to look up code for making lines/bars/scatterplots (which was never the case for matplotlib if it had been more than a few weeks since I made a plot)",2022-02-18 21:18:39

For example - 

    x = [7.5, 7.5, 17.5]
    y = [393.198, 351.352, 351.352]


    plt.plot(x,y) 

vs

    sns.lineplot(x=x,y=y)

They both are similar but plot different things because Seaborn has much more functionalities and depending on the parameters will plot differently.

Another great thing about Seaborn is that it plays very nicely with Pandas dataframes.",2022-02-18 19:10:39

Seaborn is a bit better. Plotly has a similar problem of having way too many ways of doing the same thing, and docs are a bit all over the place.

Is It Ok To Do 0-1 Scaling Then Divide By The Standard Deviation?,11,swshng,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/swshng/is_it_ok_to_do_01_scaling_then_divide_by_the/,1,1645330544.0,"Rookie here tryna learn and I read over normalization so I had a question google couldn't answer

If am understanding stuff correctly, if I have a df I can first do 0-1 scaling on it to get equal ranges while preserving the data series's original means and standard deviations and then once I divide the 0-1 scaled data by the standard deviation, I would get a variance that is 1 across all data series.

Therefore my brain concludes that doing 0-1 scaling then dividing by standard deviation leads to a data set that shares range and standard deviation thus making it better to be used in models such as SVMs, Naive Bayes, KMeans Clustering, and other Forest Based Models.

How we/I use it at work is we play around with some data, do some initial modeling, and then if it looks like this is something worth putting in production, I would create a python module and use that. One optimization I do in jupyter is try to write as many functions as possible so that later i can copy-paste easily inside python module.

It is genuinely a pretty complicated topic. For sure though you'd probably want to setup a naive baseline forecast consisting of some statistical model applied to each SKU independently (even as simple as average sales of last week extrapolated etc etc). Take a look at Table 2 of the [M4 writeup](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301128) and go up the list until you reach a level of naive forecast that you think is applicable to your data.

This of course misses all the cross-correlations and shared information across SKUs, but you are asking for an MVP after all. Lots of the naive approaches applied to individual SKUs will also be embarrassingly parallel which is a plus point.

It's not necessarily an approach that you want to genuinely use as a production forecast, especially in the case where you have lots of very under-sampled SKUs. But it sounds like you're a little overwhelmed by options and want to get something out of the door quickly. In any case, having a naive baseline for comparing improvements against is always useful.",2022-02-19 12:43:07

Comment,30,hxk86qd,,0,1645264453.0,"Was a Business Intelligence Engineer for 5+ years at a FAANG company making $180K, but shit was hitting the fan repeatedly and work life balance was horrible. Got a Principal Business Intelligence Engineer role at a well funded startup for $270K that's 100% remote and has unlimited PTO. Very happy with the move so far.

Despite the shite environment, if you're at a non-FAANG company and want that big name on your resume, now is the time. They are desperate for talent, the bar is certainly lower, and they are willing to pay! Just get ready to grind hard. After you hit 2 years, recruiters from other big companies will approach you on LinkedIn, and that's your opportunity to jump to something better. Good luck!",2022-02-19 11:54:13

Comment,38,hxjn7e1,,0,1645248596.0,"> while my employer historically could use the low cost of living as a way of keeping salaries down, these remote jobs are generally offering west coast salaries

This is absolutely happening. With remote work, companies are able to tap into talent across the whole country, and the west coast salaries are very attractive for people in the midwest. Companies with remote work that want top talent aren't going to care that their employee is in San Jose vs. San Antonio.

The companies in the midwest can't offer their salaries to anyone outside of the midwest, though, which is going to be a big problem for them. I think the brain drain hasn't hit the suits just yet and they are holding on hope that everything will ""return to normal"". Between remote options and rapid inflation, there are going to be a lot of people who will continue to leave.

My most recent interview in the midwest gave me an offer that was low enough that leaving after a couple years (or outright refusing) is an absolute no brainer, and I told them as much during the interview and negotiation phase.",2022-02-19 07:29:56

Comment,2,hxjjl4v,,0,1645246403.0,"It really seems to vary, we get posts in here and similar subs complaining how hard it is to land an entry level role in data whether it’s data scientist or data analyst. But I have no idea what kind of background/degrees those folks have, if they did any internships, how many applications they’ve submitted, etc. 

But it sounds pretty saturated at the entry level. Data Science and Analytics jobs have been pretty hyped for the past 10 years, there are tons of new masters and bachelors programs (and certificates which are pretty useless) in DS/analytics, so tons of new grads trying to land jobs. 

And to be frank, this isn’t an entry level field. Unlike software engineering, where there is a bit more work that’s straightforward and repetitive, data science and analytics isn’t always as straightforward and you need to have enough knowledge/context/experience to fill in the blanks or anticipate problems/questions, and figure out the solution. 

On top of that, while many companies are recognizing that they need data folks, they are still very early in building out data teams, and you need experienced folks to build those teams. You can’t start hiring entry level folks until your team has grown to 10-20 people and most data teams aren’t there yet.  

Salaries are all over the place but I think $50-80k is normal for a data analyst depending on industry and location. You can find some entry level DA folks in our annual salary thread (link below), and also Harnham is a recruiting firm specializing in data & analytics roles and they release an annual salary survey that seems accurate (easily found via Google). https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/re46xx/official_2021_end_of_year_salary_sharing_thread/",2022-02-19 06:53:23

I recommend trying two things: talk to see if you can get a new and clean database (probably won't happen) or you can erase the data points that you found are erroneous, to avoid training with erroneous data.

About the model, I haven't studied in deep about text classification, but I'm not so sure about how you apply the concept of distance in this case. 

From what I studied I think you should change your data type before. For example, count how many times words have appeared in a message, choose the words that appear the most, and with that information apply the model.

Comment,244,hxixoqs,,0,1645235103.0,"I work at a company that historically had very little turnover year over year. We have pretty good benefits and depending on the team generally good work life balance. One reason that turnover was so low was that a lot of the data science team was from the local area generally. Being in the Midwest this could naturally limit corporate choices for employees. 

With the rise of remote work these folks are no longer tied to my current company so we have seen a surge of talent exiting. Additionally, while my employer historically could use the low cost of living as a way of keeping salaries down, these remote jobs are generally offering west coast salaries talking with folks that have left. A lot of us are in wait and see mode to see what compensation increases look like this year. 

One final issue I have also seen is that we have started to hire more and more computer science majors as software skills become more important in data science. The issue is that we are losing these new hires after a couple of years to SWE jobs. The reality of corporate data science often doesn't align with the expectations of new college grads.

Stop resampling data in classification problems.,76,sxtppd,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/sxtppd/stop_resampling_data_in_classification_problems/,35,1645450678.0,"Resampling is a widely recommended solution to class imbalance among data scientists.  Resampling also is an awful idea.

Resampling is a take on case-control study designs, in which cases/controls are sampled in ways which do not respect the underlying frequency distribution for either cases or controls. When using logistic regression, [the effects are estimated in an unbiased way](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/558942/why-is-it-that-if-you-undersample-or-oversample-you-have-to-calibrate-your-outpu/558950#558950) but the intercept is biased.  

Additionally, [we probably don't want to be doing classification](https://www.fharrell.com/post/classification/) anyway, we mostly want to be accurately predicting risks for the outcome (risk of churn, risk of click through, whatever).  Ensuring our risk estimates are accurate vis a vis calibration and proper scoring rules allows for an appropriate risk threshold to be selected for decision making.  When you resample, all you're doing is forcing the model's probabilities to change in order to make your arbitrary decision boundary look appropriate.  You're putting the cart before the horse.

[Approaches like SMOTE do not help](https://twitter.com/MaartenvSmeden/status/1495668297630633985) (although who the hell would think that all observations within a convex subset of the feature space would all be for one class?  The idea itself is incredibly suspect to me, but I digress).

TL;DR:  Don't resample when classes are imbalanced.  If you have too few observations of one class, ask yourself if the problem is in need of ML.  Otherwise, ensure your probability predictions are calibrated and select an appropriate decision boundary.

Here is another [good post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/357466/are-unbalanced-datasets-problematic-and-how-does-oversampling-purport-to-he) should you care.",2022-02-21 15:37:58

This post garnered a lot more support and informative responses than I anticipated - thank you to everyone who contributed.

I thought it would be beneficial to others to summarize the key takeaways.

I compiled top-level notions for your perusal, however, I would still suggest going through the comments as there are a lot of very informative and thought-provoking discussions on these topics.

&#x200B;

**Interview Question:**

>"" What if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001?""

The question was surrounded around the idea of accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis.  I believe the interviewer was looking for - How I would interpret the results. Why the p-value changed.  Not much additional information or context was given. 

**Suggested Answers:**

* u/bolivlake \- [The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)

&#x200B;

* u/LilyTheBet \- Implementing a Bayesian A/B test might yield more transparent results and more practical in business decision making ([https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html))

&#x200B;

* u/glauskies \- Practical significance vs statistical significance. A lot of companies look for practical significance. There are cases where you can reject the null but the alternate hypothesis does not lead to any real-world impact.

&#x200B;

* u/dmlane \- I think the key thing the interviewer wanted to see is that you wouldn’t draw different conclusions from the two experiments.

&#x200B;

* u/Cheaptat \- Possible follow-up questions: how expensive would the change this test is designed to measure be? Was the average impact positive for the business, even if questionably measurable? What would the potential drawback of implementing it be? They may well have wanted you to state some assumptions (reasonable ones, perhaps a few key archetypes) and explain what you’d have done.

&#x200B;

* u/seesplease \- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, you have a 1/20 chance of getting a p-value below 0.05. If you test the same hypothesis twice and a p-value around 0.05 both times with an effect size in the same direction, you just witnessed a \~1/400 event assuming the null is true! Therefore, you should reject the null.

&#x200B;

* u/robml  u/-lawnder  \-Bonferroni's Correction. Common practice to avoid data snooping is that you divide the alpha threshold by the number of tests you conduct. So say I conduct 5 tests with an alpha of 0.05, I would test for an individual alpha of 0.01 to try and curtail any random significance.You divide alpha by the number of tests you do. That's your new alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/Coco_Dirichlet \- Note - If you calculate marginal effects/first differences, for some values of X there could be a significant effect on Y.

&#x200B;

* u/spyke252 \- I think they were specifically trying to test knowledge of what p-hacking is in order to avoid it!

&#x200B;

* u/dcfan105 \- an attempt to test if you'd recognize the problem with making a decision based on whether a single probability is below some arbitrary alpha value. Even if we assume that everything else in the study was solid - large sample size, potential confounding variables controlled for, etc., a p value *that* close the alpha value is clearly not very strong evidence, *especially* if a subsequent p value was just slightly above alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/quantpsychguy \- if you ran the test once and got 0.049 and then again and got 0.051, I'm seeing that the data is changing. It might represent drift of the variables (or may just be due to incomplete data you're testing on).

&#x200B;

* u/oldmangandalfstyle \- understanding to be that p-values are useless outside the context of the coefficient/difference. P-values asymptotically approach zero, so in large samples they are worthless. And also the difference between 0.049 and 0.051 is literally nothing meaningful to me outside the context of the effect size. It’s critical to understand that a p-value is strictly a conditional probability that the null is true given the observed relationship. So if it’s just a probability, and not a hard stop heuristic, how does that change your perspective of its utility?

&#x200B;

* u/24BitEraMan \- It might also be that you are attributing a perfectly fine answer to them deciding not to hire you, when they already knew who they wanted to hire and were simply looking for anything to tell you no.

&#x200B;

\-----

&#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Long story short, after weeks of interviewing, made it to the final rounds, and got rejected because of this very basic question:

Interviewer: Given you run an A/B test and the alpha is .05 and you get a p-value = .01 what do you do (in regards to accepting/rejecting h0 )?

Me: I would reject the null hypothesis.

Interviewer: Ok... what if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001 ?

Me: If the first test resulted in a p-value of .04999 and the alpha is .05 I would again reject the null hypothesis. I'm not sure I would keep running tests unless I was not confident with the power analysis and or how the tests were being conducted.

Interviewer: What else could it be?

Me: I would really need to understand what went into the test, what is the goal, are we picking the proper variables to test, are we addressing possible confounders? Did we choose the appropriate risk (alpha/beta) , is our sample size large enough, did we sample correctly (simple,random,independent), was our test run long enough?

Anyways he was not satisfied with my answer and wasn't giving me any follow-up questions to maybe steer me into the answer he was looking for and basically ended it there.

I will add I don't have a background in stats so go easy on me, I thought my answers were more or less on the right track and for some reason he was really trying to throw red herrings at me and play ""gotchas"".

Would love to know if I completely missed something obvious, and it was completely valid to reject me. :) Trying to do better next time.

Seeking Guidance on Multi-GPU setup and Parallelization,1,swgqgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/swgqgt/seeking_guidance_on_multigpu_setup_and/,1,1645295937.0," Hi there, 

I am a medical student conducting some computer vision research and so forgive me if I am a bit off on the technical details. I am in a unique position where I currently have access to two machines: one with a 3080Ti and one with a 3090. I also happen to have an extra 3080Ti on hand.  
 

Currently, I am only performing the following tasks:  
 1.) inference using a CV model on a lot of video data

2.) Training basic NLP models

3.) Some sim racing (although this is obviously less of a hardware priority)

I understand enough (I think) to know that NVLink doesn’t actually matter that much unless you have a GPU cluster, and SLI doesn’t really work across different GPUs? I am basically at the crossroads of how to better parallelize across these 3 GPUs for an optimal setup. Lately I’ve been on the data parallelization route when it comes to inference by splitting my data across machines. I am wondering however, is it worth trading a 3080Ti up for a 3090 to build a dual 3090 NVLink system? Not sure if the model I am using can take advantage of parallelization, but even if it cannot, how often is model parallelization across multi-gpu’s easily accessible/possible?  
 

Additionally, are there any other advantages of this dual 3090 setup in other regards? For sim racing graphics, handling multi-monitors, data pre-processing, handling large datasets, etc….

This is all assuming that doing any other configuration outside of a dual 3090 NVLink setup is not worth it because of efficiency losses of mixing two different GPU’s (which I am also not sure how applicable this is). Also on the first machine with 3080Ti I have a X570 motherboard which I believe would only be able to run a second GPU at 8 PCIe lanes. (I’ve read that this doesn’t actually matter but am unclear about this).

Clearly, I need a little bit of guidance and am just hoping to have a somewhat clearer understanding before I go mess around with a bunch of hardware! Any resources, advice, thoughts would be much appreciated!  
 

Thanks!!!",2022-02-19 20:38:57

Discussion: How would you approach a time series problem with spatial components (Spatio-Temporal Forecasting),12,swe9ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/swe9ll/discussion_how_would_you_approach_a_time_series/,10,1645289279.0,"As the title already describes I am interest in how you would approach a spatio-temporal forecasting problem.   
I am a data science student, currently doing a project where I want to use time and space features to predict demand.  
In detail: I would like to forecast demand such as taxi demand for a given location and time as for example described in the following [medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/new-york-yellow-taxi-demand-prediction-using-machine-learning-fc697d20ff86) using the New York-Taxi Dataset as example.  


I researched the topic a lot and found ton on information ranging from classical approaches which are pure statistical such as ARIMA to using simple and deep machine learning models. Also it seems like there has been a lot of improvement made in the last years since I found a lot of papers dealing with the NYC Taxi Demand Prediction using different models and techniques. The most recent I read were [this one (GSTNet: Global Spatial-Temporal Network for Traffic Flow Prediction)](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/gstnet-global-spatial-temporal-network-for) were they trying to predict the taxi demand using a GSTN model as well as [this one ( Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network for Taxi Demand Prediction)](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deep-multi-view-spatial-temporal-network-for) were they combined a CNN for the spatial aspect of the problem and a LSTM for the time problem. Both papers describing the process and achieved stunning results.  


Moreover I found the [DARTS Library by Unit 8](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) which offers a nice tool case for time series problems, however they unfortunately don't seem to include and possibilities for covering space aspects, so using this I would need to train an independent model for each cluster and totally loose and space relations between them.  


My thoughts so far are, that I would first cluster my data based on departures being close to one another. Furthermore I would like to include point of interest data, such as if there are a lot of restaurants or a lot of housing in the given area.   
Moreover I though also on including this information also in my later model.  
So besides passing information only time related, I would like to include also information about the space cluster where the departures happened.  


To round it up, I would be really interested in how you would approach such a problem and how you would make sure that time related features such as weather and space related features such a number of restaurants in the cluster are caputred by your model.  
Would you use a stacking approach to do so, or just go for some fancy model that is able to do both?  


Also if you have any more articles or papers dealing with this, please share (even if I am confident I did my research the past two weeks).",2022-02-19 18:47:59

Some of the data is expected to be out of date, so I may have cases where the same business has moved from location 1 to location 2 and my inputs show them in different addresses. I'm dealing with that where I can by looking for nearly identical business names in the same geographic area using fuzzywuzzy (A lot of this data was entered manually and variations in business names across sources are common), which gives me Levenshtein distance scores for naming, but I need my scoring to also reflect which address fields match too so that a good string comparison score at the same physical address is prioritized above a good one in the same zip code with a non-matching address, etc.

I'm making a score up as I go along right now to reflect the confidence of a match based on how much of the address matches and how much of the business name matches so that I can prioritize as described, but would prefer to use an established method for scoring if this is already a well-solved problem.

For a sample of this dataset (~10%) I have manually annotated labels (i.e., the ground truth). I would like to cluster this dataset to ""automate"" the annotation of the remainder of dataset. The assumption is that I can not expend the resources to label the rest. I also can't build a classifier with the labeled data because the assumption is that it does not include all possible labels present in the remaining data. I see two options for this:

1. Cluster the entire dataset. Select the clustering algorithm, number of clusters, other parameters by maximizing an external cluster validation index (e.g., ARI) on the labeled sample, thus assuming if the produced clusters conform with the manual labels, the clusters for the unlabeled data should be similarly composed (similar idea of a cluster for this data). 

2. Cluster the labeled sample only. Select the algorithm and other methodological details by maximizing an external cluster validation index. Then, use that method for the entire dataset and select algorithm parameters, number of clusters using a mix of internal validation indices and qualitative review.

Does one of these methods pass the sniff test? I haven't seen this exact use case yet in literature but I'm sure it's out there, just can't seem to find it.

"Free, actionable template to learn real-world Data Science and get hired",129,sul1kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/sul1kf/free_actionable_template_to_learn_realworld_data/,12,1645091118.0,"From my 3-year experience in London fintech as a data scientist working with C-level executives, and from the self-learning journey leading up to that, I’ve created a template to learn the data science skills that companies are looking for.

It’s the template I wish I had when I started learning data science and applying for jobs. You can personalize it to fit your interests and career aspirations.

&#x200B;

My own data science journey started four years ago. I was an unhappy electrical engineer in aerospace. I was looking for something less narrow and more challenging, so I self-learned everything I needed to know about data science. This was a long journey with many detours, but eventually I felt confident enough to start applying, and after a few months I was hired as a data scientist in a vibrant fintech startup in London.

It turned out real-world data science is quite different from what I had studied! I learned about databases, data cleaning, software engineering, but the most challenging was communicating my findings to business stakeholders - both verbally as well as with data visualizations that show a clear message. So I was anxious at first and learned slowly. Eventually I got the hang of it and worked for three years with very hands-on business data, providing real value to C-level decision makers.

&#x200B;

This is a template to self-learn the DS skills companies are looking for, in less time than it took me.

The template is based around 3 pillars:

* Math & Stats
* Software Engineering & Tools
* Data & Business Communication

The Math & Stats section contains a structured list of recommended topics and principles to learn, with links to relevant resources like [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/normal-distributions-library/v/ck12-org-normal-distribution-problems-qualitative-sense-of-normal-distributions) [Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/introduction-to-confidence-intervals/v/confidence-intervals-and-margin-of-error) [videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/vectors/v/vector-introduction-linear-algebra) and the classic books like *Introduction to Statistical Learning*).

The Software Engineering & Tools sections walks through tools to learn (based around the Jupyter-Python-Pandas ecosystem), and links to [tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&feature=emb_title), [example notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/pandas/03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb) and [cheat sheets](https://startupsventurecapital.com/essential-cheat-sheets-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-researchers-efb6a8ebd2e5) (all created by other fantastic people, I take no credit for the linked resources) to learn Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib.

The Data & Business Communication section is the real core of the template, where both of the previous sections come together. It’s shaped after the process for a typical business data science project:

* Data collection
* Data exploration
* Data cleaning & preparation
* Machine learning modeling: here I mention some common models actually used in businesses, like linear+logistic regression, random forests and timeseries forecasting
* Model evaluation
* Reporting & data visualization: focus on creating clear plots here
* Communicating with stakeholders: this is where I go more in depth on communicating your results to business decision makers, and telling a story which a layman can understand

The study content provided in the template is minimal, but you can go as in-depth as you like with the linked resources. The idea is that you study those resources by yourself, and then write down what you learned in your own words, directly into your own copy of the template.

And of course you can modify this template to your own taste. Delete what doesn’t interest you, and add more where you want to dive deeper.

&#x200B;

I like to learn with flashcards (especially to memorize common interview questions), so I’ve added some example flashcards to help you get started - you can add your own flashcards or delete them if it isn’t for you.

&#x200B;

Here’s the full template in Traverse (my app, with integrated flashcards):

What does MVP look like for inventory/demand forecast?,1,su5922,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/su5922/what_does_mvp_look_like_for_inventorydemand/,2,1645042555.0,"I've asked the question for https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/steeoo/how_do_deal_with_exploding_model_numbers/ on the bottom-up approach of predicting per-sku level, but it seems like this will be quite a lot of work especially for MVP. 

So while I would like to keep per-sku as an option for future iteration, I am wondering what are other quick ways to establish a baseline number with inventory forecasting?

I guess the difficulty I am having is that we are not just predicting sales, but sales of each sku, and not sure which ML model can handle it.",2022-02-16 22:15:55

I need to get the authors, commits, files and file changes for each of those.

I intend to do it in a multithreaded fashion because otherwise it will take too long. However, with foreign keys and such this will cause issues with race conditions. For instance authors in these repositories can be repeated and depending on who comes across an author first, several threads may erroneously attempt to insert at the same time causing errors in the process. I could just insert the data for the authors and repositories first but this is just going to be way too slow for 25000 repositories and it cannot be done in a multithreaded fashion. 

My only concern for this data is that it should be easily queryable after I store it. I won't be writing to it anymore after I obtain it. I went for postgres because I figured it would be easier to work with that when using pandas, but I'm wondering if going NoSQL might be better in the long run.

Cluster Stability visualization technique,3,styl1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/styl1p/cluster_stability_visualization_technique/,5,1645025290.0,"Full transparency here: my exposure to data science has been by trade, not by formal education or training. That comes with knowledge/terminology gaps, so I apologize in advance for those. If something isn't clicking with you, please feel free to ask clarifying questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

I had an idea for a visualization I wanted to see if there was something out there that does this already in python, or even more fundamentally if there are oversights in my thinking that would blow up this kind of approach from the get-go.

clustering basics: k-centroid clustering starts by selecting k random points and evaluating 'distances' from those k points across the remainder of the dataset. Each data point is then assigned to a 'cluster' based on which of these k points it is closest to.

The problem: those k points are assigned randomly. And we usually get around this by running a clustering exercise repeatedly. But since every single point gets assigned to a cluster, we can end up with points that are 'promiscuous' and end up in different clusters a lot. And I haven't found a good way of visually describing this.

The summary of the proposition: a kind of topographical map, where we first identify k points that are (basically) never in the same cluster. Then we track how frequently each of the various data points are in the same cluster as each of those k points. So if K1 and point 56,757 are in the same cluster 95% of the time, that pairing has a height of 0.95. And if K2 and point 5,251 are in the same cluster 50% of the time, that pairing has a height of 0.5.

So then we take the set of K that are most exclusive to each other, make a pair of orthogonal eigenvectors out of them and pretend that these are new axes. Then we plot the full dataset onto these new axes and then treat the frequency of how often those points are paired together as the 'height' of the relationship.

Then, I think, we have a topographical map. Setting a threshold of how frequently point-to-centroid pairs share a cluster is essentially like setting the sea level of this topographical map, and there's probably some curve that identifies how much information we lose for each 0.01 of the 'sea level' and then we can probably fit some half-dozen different kinds of optimization algorithms there to find out the 'ideal' height.

The resulting ""islands"" are your new, improved, and focused clusters, with 'promiscuous' data points underwater.",2022-02-16 17:28:10

Anyway, rant aside, how do you handle project requests? Do you send out a form to the business units and ask them to outline exactly what they want?

Navigating the uncertainty of what you're supposed to be doing,12,stnavk,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/stnavk/navigating_the_uncertainty_of_what_youre_supposed/,6,1644987076.0,"I've been in the ""data"" field for few years after previously training in a clinical area but never quite got the ""data scientist"" title-have been working as a statistician, then an analyst and really became advanced in my coding/programming skills over the course of the last few years. I realize I enjoy programming and could envision coding all day. My most recent job ended up being less analysis and modeling and more 'using code so I never have to do manual work again'-some of it sucked b/c but it was also rewarding to figure out how to write scripts for stuff people were doing manually for years.

However, I a pretty common theme I honestly felt in my last few jobs is that I quickly lost sight as to what I was doing because the people overseeing the projects seemed to have a lack of clear goals in their work. My work was basically centered around ad-hoc requests from people-sometimes unrealistic requests, it became repetitive and boring and everything felt like we were just doing things for the sake of doing them. 

I started applying to jobs both in my original field and data science roles in tech with the hopes I can do a job where at minimum I know what I'm supposed to be doing everyday and ended up getting got an offer at a place I originally applied for in a clinical role but ended up in a bit of a random role where I am neither doing data science (b/c they already have a team of pretty talented people who are coding, creating dashboards and modeling) or clinical work-I'm basically an in between person coming up with 'new ideas' and measures-it's really up to me to define the role. The thing is there are some clinical people who know what they are looking for when it comes to data, so it's basically right now a pipeline between them and the data team and I don't know where I fit in the puzzle. The people I work with so far are great and I do think it's nice to have the freedom of trying something new, but I feel very limited-I don't have access to the data which the data team does and they probably won't prioritize me getting access since I'm not on that team. I've been coming up with projects that aren't dashboards, but I sort of feel like I'm getting that 'doing for the sake of doing' feeling. 

I'm assuming (from some posts here) some of you have felt this way-any tips to navigate? I'm allocating some time to self-teaching and doing side projects so I still feel like I can be a part of the data world, but funnily I feel overwhelmed from being a bit underwhelmed and could use some insight how to better navigate that.

I've been talking to many folks lately about dealing with code quality in Jupyter notebooks, and I'd like to hear the perspective of the r/datascience community. To get started, here are a few things I've heard:

1. **Allow Jupyter notebooks but refactor them before deployment.** This is the most common answer, people are allowed to use notebooks but before deployment, there is a big refactoring process where the notebook is converted into scripts or functions. One problem I see with this approach is that it's slow and error-prone, sometimes results from the original notebook cannot be reproduced.
2. **Deploy notebooks as-is.** This is an interesting approach, teams execute notebooks in production. I think it works ok for simple projects (e.g. notebooks with < 100 cells)
